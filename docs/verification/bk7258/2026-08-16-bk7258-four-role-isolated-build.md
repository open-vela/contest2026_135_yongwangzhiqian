## Result

The final isolated build prepared and compiled all four required roles from
one materialized read-only entity snapshot. Every command returned zero and
reported `PASS`:

| Role | Backend | Commands | Result |
|---|---|---:|---|
| BL1 | bootloader adapter | 2 | 2/2 PASS |
| BL2 | minimal Make | 2 | 2/2 PASS |
| CP | CMake | 4 | 4/4 PASS |
| AP | CMake | 4 | 4/4 PASS |

The role-private build roots and artifact records were emitted for all four
roles. BL1/BL2 boot artifacts are explicitly marked `runnable=false` and
`trusted=false`; this is compile-only evidence, not a boot or trust result.

## Policy and boundaries

- Boot policy: `status=RECONCILED`, `execution=COMPILE_ONLY`.
- Compile side effect: `PASS`.
- `sign`, `package`, `hardware`, `network` and `private_key_read`:
  `NOT_RUN`.
- No final postbuild, signed package, Flash or hardware result is claimed.
- Final focused acceptance reported 50 tests `PASS`; `git diff --check`
  also reported `PASS`.

This record establishes the four-role isolated compile-only baseline. The next
implementation phase is isolated postbuild; signing and package delivery come
after that and signing requires separate authorization. P9b, validation
migration and hardware verification remain incomplete.
