# BK7258 T5-AI N6 SDK Integration Worklog

> **Current Stage:** N6 — Beken SDK integration, WDT handoff, and IRQ adaptation
> **Current status:** A1 80-slot RAM-vector baseline is `board-verified`. Stage B CPU0 SDK IRQ bridge is authorized and implemented on branch `bk7258-n6-sdk-irq-bridge`. F1 LCD mapped-default and F2 bridge-local lifecycle serialization are `build-verified`: exact historical stale-object RED, fresh bridge 48/48 PASS, preserved A1 suite 18/18 PASS. Final focused review is being closed before preparing a user-only non-WDT timer test. Stage B is not `board-verified`. No flash, no commit, no push.
> **Last updated:** 2026-07-23

## Documentation rule

Every substantive new change or result in this Stage must be recorded here before proceeding to the next technical step. Each update should include the change, evidence, status, conclusion, current diagnostic state, and next single minimal action. A board result that disproves an older conclusion must explicitly retract the stale conclusion.

## 2026-07-21 — WDT reset and SysTick IRQ root cause

### Objective

Replace temporary raw-register watchdog shutdown with the intended architecture:

```text
NuttX watchdog upper-half
  -> BK7258 lower-half wrapper
  -> Beken SDK bk_wdt_* / bk_aon_wdt_* APIs
```

NuttX automonitor owns periodic keepalive. The wrapper contains no raw WDT register writes.

### Effective watchdog configuration

```text
CONFIG_WATCHDOG_AUTOMONITOR=y
CONFIG_WATCHDOG_AUTOMONITOR_BY_WDOG=y
CONFIG_WATCHDOG_AUTOMONITOR_TIMEOUT=8
CONFIG_WATCHDOG_AUTOMONITOR_PING_INTERVAL=2
```

Expected runtime chain:

```text
SysTick (10 ms)
  -> systick_interrupt()
  -> nxsched_process_timer()
  -> wd_timer()
  -> watchdog_automonitor_wdog() every 2 s
  -> lower-half keepalive()
  -> bk_wdt_feed()
```

### Controlled SDK WDT initialization

Current overlay sequence in `board/bk7258_t5ai/chip/bk7258_wdt.c`:

```text
bk_timer_driver_init()
bk_wdt_driver_init()
bk_timer_stop(TIMER_ID2)
bk_aon_wdt_stop()
watchdog_register("/dev/watchdog0", ...)
```

The SDK initializes its internal WDT state, TIMER_ID2 is then stopped so NuttX automonitor owns periodic feeding, and the bootloader AON watchdog is stopped through the SDK API.

### Diagnostic markers

Temporary markers were introduced to isolate the failure:

| Marker | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `A` | immediately before `watchdog_register()` |
| `B` | registration, timeout setup, and lower-half `bk_wdt_start()` returned |
| `W` | direct one-tick NuttX `wd_start()` probe was accepted |
| `T` | the one-tick WDog probe callback executed |
| `K` | automonitor first called lower-half `keepalive()` and `bk_wdt_feed()` |
| `s` | temporary direct SysTick vector-entry probe executed |

### Rejected hypotheses

#### SDK start or registration hangs

Board result:

```text
AB
NuttShell (NSH)
...
HF
```

`B` proved `watchdog_register()` and SDK `bk_wdt_start()` returned. The failure was after registration.

Status: `rejected`.

#### Global PRIMASK or BASEPRI remains disabled

Forcing `up_irq_enable()` and then `up_irq_restore(0)` did not produce `K`.

Status: `rejected`; both forced-mask experiments were removed.

#### `wd_start()` rejects the automonitor event

A direct one-tick WDog probe produced:

```text
ABW
```

`W` proved insertion succeeded, but neither its `T` callback nor automonitor `K` ran.

Conclusion: the NuttX WDog queue was populated but not serviced.

Status: `board-verified` observation.

### SysTick hardware-entry probe

The existing temporary vector probe was connected directly to vector slot 15. Board result:

```text
sABW
NuttShell (NSH)
...
HF
```

` s ` proved all of the following:

- SysTick counter and interrupt generation work;
- TICKINT is enabled;
- VTOR points to the expected vector table;
- vector slot 15 is fetched correctly;
- Cortex-M33 can enter and return from the SysTick exception.

This excluded the SysTick hardware setup and global interrupt masks. The failure boundary moved to the NuttX dispatch path beginning at `exception_direct`.

Status: `board-verified`.

### Final SysTick change

Changed only vector slot 15:

```c
[15]         = &exception_common;
[16 ... 63] = &exception_direct;
```

Board result:

```text
ABWT
NuttShell (NSH)
nsh> [ipc_svr]
create_socket failed.
K
```

The board remained running and no longer entered the 8-second reset loop.

Status: `board-verified`.

### Confirmed root-cause boundary

> On the current BK7258 port, SysTick routed through `exception_direct` did not complete NuttX tick/WDog processing. Routing SysTick through the full context-saving `exception_common -> arm_doirq -> irq_dispatch` path restored `nxsched_process_timer()`, the WDog queue, watchdog automonitor, and `bk_wdt_feed()`.

The exact failing instruction or ABI assumption inside the optimized `exception_direct` path has not been isolated and is not required for the current functional recovery.

The shared diagnostic `HF` marker is used by both vector slot 2 (NMI) and slot 3 (HardFault). In this failure chain it was consistent with WDT expiry entering NMI; it was not proof of an ordinary software HardFault.

## 2026-07-21 — BK7236N IRQ reference comparison

Reference files under `$VENDOR_BEKEN/chips/bk7236n/` show three missing or incorrect parts in the BK7258 overlay.

### 1. Exception entry choice

`beken_head.S` routes SysTick and defined external IRQ handlers to `exception_common`, not `exception_direct`:

```asm
handler_name:
    b exception_common
```

This matches the BK7258 board result above.

### 2. SDK-to-NuttX IRQ bridge

`beken_interrupt_base.c` reimplements `bk_int_isr_register()` in the NuttX adaptation layer:

```text
SDK interrupt source
  -> map to NuttX IRQ number
  -> irq_attach(wrapper)
  -> up_enable_irq()
  -> wrapper calls the SDK ISR callback
```

The BK7258 overlay currently lacks an equivalent bridge. The precompiled SDK implementation registers callbacks in its private `s_irq_handler[]` and enables NVIC directly; NuttX `irq_dispatch()` does not automatically consult that private table.

This remains a likely blocker for SDK Timer/UART and later SDK modules.

Status: `static-only`; not yet board-verified as a complete fix.

### 3. IRQ count definition — superseded finding

BK7258 currently defines:

```c
#define NR_IRQS 48
```

The initial comparison incorrectly assumed that BK7258 had only 48 external
IRQs and proposed `NR_IRQS=64`. Targeted BK7258 SDK inspection later proved
that its ICU map, fixed handlers and private callback table cover external
NVIC indices 0 through 63. Therefore the complete logical NuttX space would
normally be 80 IRQ numbers, not 64.

The current value is still incomplete, but it must not be corrected in
isolation because mandatory boot magic occupies vector slot 64. See the later
"Targeted SDK IRQ and multicore evidence" section.

Status: earlier 48-external proposal `rejected`; full correction `blocked` on
runtime vector layout design.

## 2026-07-21 — UART IRQ step 1: full exception entry

### Change

Changed the BK7258 custom vector table in
`board/bk7258_t5ai/chip/bk7258_vectors.c` from:

```c
[15]         = &exception_common;
[16 ... 63] = &exception_direct;
```

to:

```c
[15 ... 63] = &exception_common;
```

The now-unused `exception_direct` declaration and stale vector-table comments
were removed or updated. Slots 2 and 3 remain connected to the temporary
`bk7258_hardfault_handler`; slots 4 through 63 now use `exception_common`.

### Rationale and evidence boundary

The preceding SysTick experiment board-verified that the complete
`exception_common -> arm_doirq -> irq_dispatch` path restores NuttX interrupt
processing. The BK7236N reference also routes its external IRQ handlers through
`exception_common`. This change applies the same entry path to all 48 BK7258
external vector slots so the already attached NuttX UART1 ISR can receive RX
interrupt dispatch.

Status: `static-only`.

This source change has not yet been built or board-tested. It does not yet
prove UART RX works, and it does not correct the independent `NR_IRQS=48`
definition or add the SDK-to-NuttX IRQ bridge.

Current diagnostic state: the WDT `A/B/W/T/K` markers and unused SysTick probe
remain unchanged so the next board run can simultaneously detect a WDT
regression.

Next single minimal action: build this vector-only change, then flash and test
UART RX at the NSH prompt. If boot, WDT stability, or UART behavior regresses,
restore only external slots 16 through 63 to `exception_direct` before further
IRQ changes.

## 2026-07-21 — UART RX external-IRQ path board verification

### Board evidence

After building and flashing the external-vector change, the board reached NSH
with the expected watchdog markers:

```text
ABWT
NuttShell (NSH)
nsh> [ipc_svr]
create_socket failed.
K
```

UART input was accepted repeatedly and NSH executed commands:

```text
nsh> ls
/:
 data/
 dev/
 proc/

nsh> cat /data/probe.txt
BK7258LFS-OK
```

### Conclusion

External vector slots 16 through 63 using `exception_common` restore the
NuttX UART1 RX interrupt path. UART RX and command dispatch are therefore
`board-verified`. The final shown boot also retained watchdog automonitor
feeding (`T`/`K`) and LittleFS access to the persistent probe file.

The log contains a transition from an earlier boot to a second boot immediately
after `K`; without reset-cause attribution it is not used as evidence of either
a spontaneous watchdog reset or a manual reset. The sustained second boot is
the UART RX verification point.

Status: `board-verified`.

This result verifies the exception-entry choice for the existing NuttX UART
ISR. It does not fix the undersized NuttX IRQ-number space and does not prove
that precompiled SDK modules using the SDK-private ISR table can dispatch
through NuttX.

Current diagnostic state: external slots 16 through 63 remain on
`exception_common`; `A/B/W/T/K` and the unused SysTick probe remain pending
final cleanup.

Next single minimal action: correct the IRQ count split to 48 external IRQs and
64 total NuttX IRQ numbers, then rebuild and board-test the same UART/WDT
baseline before implementing the SDK IRQ bridge.

## 2026-07-21 — Tri-core SMP/AMP design boundary

The current verified port runs one NuttX instance on CPU0; therefore the
current vector, NVIC, UART and SDK IRQ bridge work is scoped to CPU0. A
three-core chip does not by itself mean that the current NuttX configuration
is SMP. Other cores running separate SDK firmware would be an AMP arrangement
and must retain their own local interrupt handling, with cross-core events
using the chip IPC/mailbox path rather than CPU0 `g_irqvector[]`.

The CPU0 bridge should nevertheless avoid UP-only assumptions: protect shared
registration state with a spinlock rather than only local interrupt masking,
separate one-time callback-table initialization from per-core NVIC setup, and
make interrupt ownership/routing explicit. It must not silently enable the
same peripheral IRQ on multiple cores.

A future NuttX SMP port would be a separate architecture milestone requiring
secondary-core startup, per-core VTOR/IRQ-stack setup, inter-processor
interrupts, scheduler SMP hooks, per-core timer policy, interrupt affinity and
cache/coherency validation. The SDK IRQ bridge alone does not provide those
facilities and must not be described as tri-core SMP completion.

Status: `static-only` design constraint. Preserve room for later per-core
routing rather than mixing SMP bring-up into the current UART/WDT recovery
stage.

## 2026-07-21 — Targeted SDK IRQ and multicore evidence

The BK7258 SDK does not use the earlier assumed 48-entry external IRQ model.
Targeted source inspection established the following static facts:

- `middleware/soc/bk7258/soc/icu_map.h` maps 64 SDK interrupt sources
  one-to-one to external NVIC indices 0 through 63. `INT_SRC_MAILBOX` maps to
  external IRQ 63.
- `middleware/driver/bk7258/interrupt.c` defines handlers for external IRQs
  0 through 63. Each fixed vector handler calls `arch_interrupt_get_handler()`
  and then invokes the callback stored for that NVIC index.
- `middleware/arch/cm33/arch_interrupt.c` owns a local
  `s_irq_handler[64]`. Registration stores a callback, sets priority and
  enables that local NVIC IRQ; unregistration disables it and clears the
  callback. The SDK `bk_int_isr_register()` path ignores its `arg` parameter.
- SDK startup sources provide separate CPU0, CPU1 and CPU2 vector tables. The
  inspected BK7258 library configuration sets `CONFIG_CPU_CNT=2`, while
  optional `CONFIG_SOC_SMP` paths and AMP resource/mailbox code coexist.
- Under `CONFIG_SOC_SMP`, mailbox channels are explicitly hard-bound to a
  processor through `sys_drv_core_intr_group2_enable()`. AMP resource sharing
  uses mailbox IPC and per-CPU ownership/counting.

This overturns the previous proposed constants. A complete NuttX logical IRQ
space for 64 external IRQs would normally require:

```text
BK7258_EXTERNAL_IRQS = 64
NR_IRQS = 16 + 64 = 80
```

However, the current bootable NuttX image places mandatory bootloader magic at
image offset `0x100`, which is vector slot 64. A contiguous 80-entry runtime
vector table would need slots 64 through 79 for external IRQs 48 through 63,
so simply changing `NR_IRQS` to 80 would overwrite or conflict with the boot
magic layout. The current table only provides external IRQs 0 through 47;
UART1 works because it is external IRQ 15.

Status: `static-only`, newly identified blocker. The earlier
"48 external IRQs / `NR_IRQS=64`" correction is `rejected` and must not be
implemented.

Next single minimal action: reconcile the vendor boot image/vector layout with
its 64-entry runtime IRQ table and determine whether NuttX must keep a minimal
boot table at the image origin and switch VTOR after reset to a separate full
80-slot runtime table. Do not implement the SDK bridge or change IRQ counts
until this layout is proven.

## Corrections to earlier conclusions

The following earlier conclusions are explicitly retracted:

- The stable root cause is **not** “320 MHz changes the bootloader watchdog from about 8 seconds to about 1 second.” Current board behavior showed an approximately 8-second expiry matching the configured timeout.
- Raw APB/AON register writes are **not** the final WDT solution. They were removed; the stable path uses the SDK wrapper and NuttX automonitor.
- `bk_aon_wdt_stop()` is not the current failure source; it operates successfully in the board-verified chain.
- `bk_timer_start: ret=-0x1f02` identifies an uninitialized SDK timer driver but was not the final cause of the 8-second reset.

## Current code and diagnostic state

- `board/bk7258_t5ai/chip/bk7258_vectors.c`
  - SysTick slot 15 and external IRQ slots 16 through 63 use `exception_common`.
  - the external-IRQ entry change and UART RX are `board-verified`.
  - the unused temporary `bk7258_systick_probe()` remains and must be removed during cleanup.
- `board/bk7258_t5ai/chip/bk7258_wdt.c`
  - temporary `A/B/K` markers remain;
  - the temporary one-tick `W/T` probe remains;
  - controlled SDK initialization and TIMER_ID2 stop remain.
- `[ipc_svr] create_socket failed.` is a separate issue and was not part of the WDT reset chain.

## Next single-step sequence

Perform these one at a time, documenting each result here before continuing:

1. Reconcile the bootloader magic at vector slot 64 with the SDK's 64 external IRQs; determine and prove the full runtime VTOR/table layout.
2. Only after that, define the complete NuttX IRQ space (normally 80 logical IRQs for 64 external sources) and board-test the UART/WDT baseline.
3. Implement the CPU0 overlay SDK IRQ bridge without modifying SDK source, then exercise at least one SDK-owned interrupt source.
4. Extend or constrain multicore routing according to the proven AMP/SMP execution model; do not assume all cores share one NuttX IRQ table.
5. Remove `A/B/W/T/K`, the unused SysTick probe, and stale comments after IRQ behavior is stable, then regress WDT, UART RX, DVFS and LittleFS.

## Constraints

- Make contest changes only inside the team overlay.
- Do not modify the SDK source tree or the generated official NuttX/vendor/package checkouts.
- Do not restore raw-register WDT shutdown in NuttX bring-up.
- Build, flash, commit, and push remain separately authorized actions.

## 2026-07-22 — A0 RAM-vector plumbing

### Objective

Enable standard NuttX RAM-vector relocation for the current BK7258 CPU0
configuration without changing the current IRQ count, the 66-entry flash boot
table, or any SDK/official NuttX source.

### Change

- `board/bk7258_t5ai/chip/Kconfig`: `ARCH_CHIP_BK7258` now selects
  `ARCH_RAMVECTORS`; Cortex-M33 already provides `ARCH_HAVE_RAMVECTORS`.
- `board/bk7258_t5ai/scripts/ld.script`: added a retained `NOLOAD`
  `.ram_vectors` RAM section after `.irq_stack`, aligned to 512 bytes, with
  `_sram_vectors`/`_eram_vectors` boundaries and a 512-byte alignment assertion.
- Reused the existing `CONFIG_ARCH_RAMVECTORS`-guarded
  `arm_ramvec_initialize()` call in `bk7258_irq.c`; that file was not changed.

### Scope and static reasoning

- `NR_IRQS` and `ARMV8M_PERIPHERAL_INTERRUPTS` are unchanged.
- The 66-entry flash `_vectors` table and mandatory magic at slots 64/65 are
  unchanged.
- With the current definitions, standard NuttX RAM-vector sizing remains 64
  entries (`0x100` bytes); flash magic entries 64/65 are outside that runtime
  copy and remain in flash. This is a static expectation pending build evidence.
- No SDK IRQ bridge, vector-table expansion, or runtime magic-slot repair was
  implemented.

### Status and evidence boundary

Status: `blocked` (superseded by artifact gate failure below).

The A0 package build completed successfully (exit 0) on 2026-07-22, but
subsequent artifact inspection revealed that `CONFIG_ARCH_RAMVECTORS` was not
set in the generated `.config`, so standard RAM vectors were not activated.
See the "A0 artifact gate failure" section below. The earlier
`build-verified` label referred only to compilation/link/package success and
is superseded by the artifact failure finding.

### Next single minimal action

Targeted read-only diagnosis of the effective BK7258 Kconfig path and why the
`select ARCH_RAMVECTORS` did not propagate into the generated config. Do not
start A1/SDK bridge or flash.

## 2026-07-22 — A0 authorized build result

defconfig.tmp   saved (no configuration change)
```

### Evidence boundary

This result proves compilation, linking, CRC expansion, and packaging completed
without error. No further evidence has been gathered:

- Generated `.config` has not been inspected for `CONFIG_ARCH_RAMVECTORS=y` or
  other A0 gate symbols.
- ELF/map section and symbol checks have not been performed (`.ram_vectors`
  placement, 512-byte alignment, `g_ram_vectors` size, `arm_ramvec_initialize`/
  `arm_ramvec_attach` linkage).
- Raw image offsets have not been inspected (flash `_vectors` table, magic at
  slot 64/65, boot header layout).
- No flash, board test, commit, or push was performed.

### Status

`blocked` — package-build success (exit 0) confirmed, but superseded by the
artifact gate failure documented below. `CONFIG_ARCH_RAMVECTORS` was not present
in the generated `.config`, so standard RAM vectors were not activated. A0 is
not build-verified as a functional RAM-vector change and is not `board-verified`.

### Next single minimal action

Targeted read-only diagnosis of the effective BK7258 Kconfig path and why the
`select ARCH_RAMVECTORS` did not propagate into the generated config.

## 2026-07-22 — A0 artifact gate failure: ARCH_RAMVECTORS not enabled

### Evidence report

Full artifact verification report: `/tmp/bk7258-a0-artifact-verification-20260722.md`

### PASS evidence

| Gate | Detail |
|---|---|
| Config | `CONFIG_ARCH_HAVE_CUSTOM_VECTORS=y` present in generated `.config` |
| Flash vectors | `_vectors` at `0x02010000`, symbol size `0x108` (264 bytes, 66 entries) |
| Magic bytes | Exact raw bytes `42 4b 37 32 33 36 00 00` (`BK7236\0\0`) at `nuttx.bin+0x100` |
| RAM section | `.ram_vectors` output section exists exactly once at a 512-byte-aligned RAM address (`0x28000800`) |
| Partition | `nuttx.bin` = 156,380 bytes (`0x262DC`) < `0x100000` partition gate |
| Packaging | `app_burn_offset=0x11000`, combined magic offset `0x11110`, all-app.bin = bl_crc.bin + nuttx_crc.bin = 235,790 bytes |

### FAIL evidence

| Gate | Detail |
|---|---|
| Config | `CONFIG_ARCH_RAMVECTORS` absent / not set in generated `.config` |
| RAM section size | `.ram_vectors` section size is `0x0` (expected `0x100`) |
| Symbol span | `_sram_vectors == _eram_vectors == 0x28000800` (end minus start = `0x0`) |
| g_ram_vectors | Symbol absent from ELF and map |
| arm_ramvec_initialize | Not linked into ELF (0 definitions) |
| arm_ramvec_attach | Not linked into ELF (0 definitions) |

### Conclusion

Build/package success did not activate standard RAM vectors. The immediate
evidence boundary is that the source-level `select ARCH_RAMVECTORS` did not
propagate into the generated config used by this build. Kconfig
reachability/effective-path diagnosis has not been performed; the root cause
is not yet claimed.

### Status

`blocked`. No flash, board test, commit, or push was performed.

### Next single minimal action

Targeted read-only diagnosis of the effective BK7258 Kconfig path/symbol
dependency and why the select is absent. Do not start A1/SDK bridge or flash.

## 2026-07-22 — A0 artifact failure root cause: stale generated config

### Objective

Prove why `CONFIG_ARCH_RAMVECTORS` was absent from the generated `.config`
despite the source-level `select ARCH_RAMVECTORS` in `ARCH_CHIP_BK7258`, and
establish the root cause before any fix or rebuild.

### Evidence table

| Item | Result | Implication |
|---|---|---|
| Effective vendor `chip/Kconfig` inode | 2487570, md5 `68df40f443ba9cf8f91f217d673b873e` | Same file object |
| Effective team overlay `chip/Kconfig` inode | 2487570, md5 `68df40f443ba9cf8f91f217d673b873e` | Identical content; H1 (path/staleness) rejected |
| Generated `.config` `CONFIG_ARCH_CHIP_BK7258` | `=y` | Correct chip selected |
| Generated `.config` `CONFIG_ARCH_CORTEXM33` | `=y` | Correct architecture |
| Generated `.config` `CONFIG_ARCH_HAVE_CUSTOM_VECTORS` | `=y` | Custom vector prerequisite met |

| Kconfig `chip/Kconfig` mtime | 2026-07-22 00:24:37 | Select was present before build |
| `.config` mtime | 2026-07-21 18:43:22 | **5 hours 41 minutes 15 seconds older** than Kconfig |
| `configure.sh` invocation | `configure.sh -e` | `-e` = existing config mode |
| Source defconfig vs `nuttx/defconfig` backup | Identical | No defconfig delta to trigger regeneration |
| `configure.sh` behavior | Printed `No configuration change.`; exited before regenerating `.config` or re-evaluating Kconfig | Stale `.config` reused as-is |
| H4 conflicting rule | No Kconfig rule forces `ARCH_RAMVECTORS` off | H4 rejected |

### Hypothesis verdicts

| Hypothesis | Verdict | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| H1 — wrong/stale Kconfig file path | **Rejected** | Vendor and overlay `chip/Kconfig` resolve to identical inode 2487570 and md5 `68df40f443ba9cf8f91f217d673b873e` |
| H2 — missing Kconfig dependency | **Rejected** | `CONFIG_ARCH_HAVE_RAMVECTORS=y` is present; `select` does not require the user to enable anything |
| H3 — stale generated `.config` not regenerated after Kconfig edit | **Confirmed** | Kconfig mtime (00:24:37) is 5h41m15s newer than `.config` mtime (18:43:22); `configure.sh -e` saw identical defconfig and exited early |
| H4 — conflicting rule forces RAMVECTORS off | **Rejected** | No such rule found in Kconfig tree |

### Root-cause conclusion

The Kconfig `select ARCH_RAMVECTORS` edit in `chip/Kconfig` (mtime 2026-07-22
00:24:37) was never evaluated during the A0 build. The build ran
`configure.sh -e`, which compares the source defconfig against the backup
`nuttx/defconfig`. Because they were identical, `configure.sh` printed
`No configuration change.` and exited early, reusing the stale generated
`.config` (mtime 2026-07-21 18:43:22 — 5 hours 41 minutes 15 seconds older
than the Kconfig edit). The `select` was therefore never evaluated, and
`CONFIG_ARCH_RAMVECTORS` remained unset. This is H3: stale generated config
reused after Kconfig source edit.

### Evidence boundary

- The Kconfig `select` source edit is proven present and correct.
- The stale `.config` reuse is proven by mtime delta and `configure.sh -e`
  early-exit behavior.
- No conflicting Kconfig rule was found (H4 rejected).
- No fix has been applied. No rebuild, flash, board test, commit, or push
  occurred after this diagnosis.

### Status

`blocked` — root cause proven; artifact failure is a config-staleness issue,
not a Kconfig or source defect. A0 remains not build-verified as a functional
RAM-vector change and not `board-verified`.

### Candidate next actions (requiring explicit user authorization/decision)

Two candidate config-refresh approaches exist:

1. **Persist `CONFIG_ARCH_RAMVECTORS=y` in the team overlay defconfig** so that
   `configure.sh -e` detects a defconfig change and regenerates `.config`,
   causing Kconfig `select` to be re-evaluated.
2. **Force a clean config regeneration path** (e.g., `distclean` + `configure.sh`
   without `-e`, or manual deletion of `.config`) before rebuilding.

Neither approach has been selected or executed. The smallest next action is
obtaining explicit user authorization for one config-refresh approach. Do not
proceed to A1/SDK bridge, flash, or board test until the config-refresh
choice is authorized and a rebuild confirms `CONFIG_ARCH_RAMVECTORS=y` in
the generated `.config`.

## 2026-07-22 — A0 config-refresh path authorized

### User decision

User selected approach 2: **distclean + rebuild**.

The approved Kconfig `select ARCH_RAMVECTORS` in `ARCH_CHIP_BK7258` remains
the sole source-level enablement. `CONFIG_ARCH_RAMVECTORS=y` will NOT be
added to the team overlay defconfig. The test is whether a freshly generated
config (from distclean) correctly evaluates the existing `select` statement.

### Authorized commands

Only these two commands are authorized for the next action:

```text
./build.sh vendor/openvela/boards/contest2026_135_bk7258/configs/nsh distclean
./build.sh vendor/openvela/boards/contest2026_135_bk7258/configs/nsh -j8
```

### Scope boundary

Flash, board testing, source/config/defconfig edits, commit, and push remain
unauthorized. No artifact inspection until after the fresh rebuild completes
and the result is recorded here.

### Status

`blocked` — pending the fresh rebuild and artifact gate check.

### Next single minimal action

Run the documented distclean, then rebuild once, and record the result (exit
code, `.config` symbols, `.ram_vectors` section, `g_ram_vectors` symbol,
`arm_ramvec_initialize` linkage) here before any artifact inspection or
further action.

## 2026-07-22 — A0 authorized distclean and fresh rebuild result

### Commands and workspace

```text
cd /home/lijian/project/open-vela
./build.sh vendor/openvela/boards/contest2026_135_bk7258/configs/nsh distclean
./build.sh vendor/openvela/boards/contest2026_135_bk7258/configs/nsh -j8
```

Workspace root: `/home/lijian/project/open-vela`

### Distclean

- Command: `./build.sh vendor/openvela/boards/contest2026_135_bk7258/configs/nsh distclean`
- Exit code: **0** (success)
- Log: `/tmp/bk7258-a0-distclean-20260722.log`
- Observed final lines:

```text
No configuration change.
make: Entering directory '/home/lijian/project/open-vela/nuttx'
make: Leaving directory '/home/lijian/project/open-vela/nuttx'
```

The `No configuration change.` line is recorded factually. Whether the A0
`select ARCH_RAMVECTORS` was activated during distclean has not been
determined from this output alone; the artifact gate (fresh `.config`
inspection) is the authoritative check.

### Fresh rebuild

- Command: `./build.sh vendor/openvela/boards/contest2026_135_bk7258/configs/nsh -j8`
- Exit code: **0** (success)
- Log: `/tmp/bk7258-a0-clean-rebuild-20260722.log`

### Generated output

```text
nuttx.bin       = 156436 bytes (logical 0x26314, physical 0x28952)
nuttx_crc.bin   = 166226 bytes
bl_crc.bin      = 69632 bytes (physical 0x0 .. 0x69631)
all-app.bin     = 235558 bytes (= bl_crc.bin + nuttx_crc.bin)
```

### Edit and action boundary

No source, config, defconfig, or docs files were edited by the build runner.
No flash, board test, commit, or push was performed.

### Evidence boundary

Only command success and package output are known from this result. The fresh
`.config`, `.ram_vectors` section sizing, `g_ram_vectors` symbol,
`arm_ramvec_initialize`/`arm_ramvec_attach` linkage, ELF/map layout, and raw
image magic/offsets have **not** yet been inspected.

### Status

`blocked` — distclean and rebuild both succeeded (exit 0), but the artifact
gate (fresh `.config` containing `CONFIG_ARCH_RAMVECTORS=y`, `.ram_vectors`
section size `0x100`, `g_ram_vectors` present, `arm_ramvec_initialize` linked)
has not been checked. A0 remains not build-verified as a functional
RAM-vector change and not `board-verified`.

### Next single minimal action

Inspect the fresh generated config/ELF/map/raw image once to determine
whether `CONFIG_ARCH_RAMVECTORS=y` is now present and RAM vectors are
active. Do not flash.

### Evidence report

Full artifact verification report:
`/tmp/bk7258-a0-clean-artifact-verification-20260722.md`

### PASS evidence (15 gates)

| Gate | Detail |
|---|---|
| Config | `CONFIG_ARCH_HAVE_CUSTOM_VECTORS=y`, `CONFIG_ARCH_HAVE_RAMVECTORS=y`, `CONFIG_ARCH_RAMVECTORS=y` — all three present |
| RAM section | `.ram_vectors` exactly once, type `SHT_NOBITS` (NOLOAD), address `0x28000800`, size `0x100`, 512-byte aligned |
| Symbol span | `_sram_vectors=0x28000800`, `g_ram_vectors` size `0x100` (OBJECT, BSS), `_eram_vectors=0x28000900`; end minus start = `0x100` |
| arm_ramvec_initialize | Exactly one definition at `0x020107f0`, 48 bytes |
| Flash vectors | `_vectors` at `0x02010000`, symbol size `0x108` (264 bytes, 66 entries) |
| Magic bytes | Exact raw bytes `42 4b 37 32 33 36 00 00` (`BK7236\0\0`) at `nuttx.bin+0x100` |
| Partition | `nuttx.bin` = 156,436 bytes (`0x26314`) < `0x100000` partition gate |
| Packaging | `app_burn_offset=0x11000`, combined magic offset `0x11110`, all-app.bin = bl_crc.bin + nuttx_crc.bin = 235,858 bytes |

### FAIL evidence (1 gate)

| Gate | Detail |
|---|---|
| arm_ramvec_attach | `arm_m/arm_ramvec_attach.c` compiled per build log (`CC: arm_m/arm_ramvec_attach.c`) but `arm_ramvec_attach` has zero defined symbols in final ELF and is absent from map file. Linker garbage collection removed it because the current binary has no retained call site referencing this function. |

### Conclusion

The stale `.config` root cause from the earlier artifact failure is **resolved**:
`CONFIG_ARCH_RAMVECTORS=y` is now set, `.ram_vectors` is a proper `SHT_NOBITS`
section of `0x100` bytes at `0x28000800`, and `arm_ramvec_initialize` is linked.
The RAM vector table and bulk initialization path are in place.

The approved A0 gate is 15/16 and remains `blocked` on understanding and
retaining the standard per-vector attach path. `arm_ramvec_attach` was compiled
but the linker discarded it because no code in the current binary calls it.
This means the runtime `irq_attach` -> `arm_ramvec_attach` path is unavailable.

### Evidence boundary

- Stale `.config` issue: **resolved** (clean rebuild produced correct config).
- RAM table and initialization path: **linked** (`arm_ramvec_initialize` present).
- Per-vector attach path: **not retained** (`arm_ramvec_attach` absent from ELF).
- No flash, VTOR, board test, commit, or push was performed.

### Status

`blocked` — 15/16 gates pass; single remaining failure is `arm_ramvec_attach`
absent from final ELF due to linker dead-code elimination.

### Next single minimal action

Targeted read-only trace of NuttX `irq_attach` / RAM-vector integration and
current config to determine why no final reference retains `arm_ramvec_attach`.
Do not fix, rebuild, flash, or start A1/SDK bridge yet.

## 2026-07-22 — A0 remaining gate root cause: arm_ramvec_attach is A1-only

### Objective

Explain why `arm_ramvec_attach` is absent from the final ELF despite
`CONFIG_ARCH_RAMVECTORS=y` being correctly set, and classify the failure as
an implementation defect, a build/link defect, or a verification-plan defect.

### Call-path evidence

| Item | Source file | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `arm_ramvec_initialize()` | `nuttx/arch/arm/src/arm_m/arm_ramvec.c` | Bulk-copies the flash vector table into `g_ram_vectors[]`; called once during early init. |
| `arm_ramvec_attach()` | `nuttx/arch/arm/src/arm_m/arm_ramvec_attach.c` | Writes a single `g_ram_vectors[]` slot at runtime; called by chip/board code that installs a direct RAM vector for a specific IRQ. |
| `irq_attach()` | `nuttx/sched/irq/irq_attach.c` | Writes the software `g_irqvector[]` dispatch table only; **never** calls `arm_ramvec_attach()`. |

All actual NuttX callers of `arm_ramvec_attach()` in the upstream tree are
explicit chip/board low-latency or direct-vector users — for example, Nordic
SDC and STM32 high-priority timer/vector examples. These are opt-in callers
that deliberately install a RAM-resident fast-path vector for a specific IRQ.

The current BK7258 A0 port calls only `arm_ramvec_initialize()`. It does not
install any direct RAM vectors; all IRQs route through
`exception_common -> arm_doirq -> irq_dispatch -> g_irqvector[]`. There are
zero call sites for `arm_ramvec_attach()` in the current binary.

### Hypothesis verdicts

| Hypothesis | Verdict | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| H1 — generic NuttX integration should have retained `arm_ramvec_attach` | **Rejected** | `irq_attach()` writes only `g_irqvector[]` and never calls `arm_ramvec_attach()`. The two are independent dispatch mechanisms. |
| H2 — linker GC correctly discards an unreferenced function | **Confirmed** | `arm_ramvec_attach.c` is compiled (build log shows `CC: arm_m/arm_ramvec_attach.c`) but no code in the final binary references the symbol. Linker `--gc-sections` correctly removes it. |
| H3 — build or link defect caused the symbol to be lost | **Rejected** | Compilation succeeded; the source is present. The only reason it is not in the final ELF is the absence of any call site, which is correct behavior for the current A0 configuration. |

### Defect classification

This is a **verification-plan defect**, not an implementation or build defect.

The plan (`/home/lijian/.claude/plans/happy-snuggling-dawn.md`) A0 line 49
requires `arm_ramvec_attach` to be present in the final ELF as an artifact
gate. However, the same plan introduces the first call site for
`arm_ramvec_attach` only in A1 runtime repair (lines 109–118). A0 has no
caller, so linker GC correctly discards the function. The gate is
overconstrained: it requires a symbol that the plan itself does not wire in
until the next substage.

### Evidence boundary

- `arm_ramvec_initialize` (bulk init): **linked** at `0x020107f0`, 48 bytes.
- `arm_ramvec_attach` (per-vector repair): **compiled**, zero references in final binary, correctly discarded by `--gc-sections`.
- `irq_attach` path: writes `g_irqvector[]` only; proven independent of `arm_ramvec_attach`.
- All NuttX upstream callers are explicit chip/board low-latency users; none are generic.
- Artificial `EXTERN`/`KEEP`/dummy retention would add unused code and satisfy only the symbol-count gate, with no runtime correctness effect.

### Status

`blocked` — pending user decision on the conflicting gate. No source, plan,
config, defconfig, build, flash, board test, commit, or push has been
performed after this diagnosis.

### Decision options

1. **Recommended:** Move the `arm_ramvec_attach` final-symbol requirement from A0 to A1, where the plan introduces its first call site (runtime repair lines 109–118). This aligns the artifact gate with the actual call-graph boundary and requires no dead-symbol retention.
2. **Fallback:** Force `arm_ramvec_attach` to be retained in the linker script (e.g., `EXTERN` or `KEEP` in `.ram_vectors` support) to satisfy the A0 gate as currently written. This adds unused code with no runtime correctness effect.

Neither option has been selected or executed.

### Next single minimal action

Obtain user decision on which gate-correction approach to apply. Do not edit
source, plan, config, or defconfig; do not rebuild, flash, board-test,
commit, or push until the decision is recorded.

## 2026-07-22 — A0 verification gate corrected; build verification complete

### Objective

Correct the overconstrained A0 verification gate that required `arm_ramvec_attach`
in the final ELF, and confirm A0 is `build-verified` under the corrected gate.

### Decision

User selected the recommended move-to-A1 decision (option 1 from the prior entry):
move the `arm_ramvec_attach` final-symbol requirement from A0 to A1, where the plan
introduces its first call site (runtime repair of slots 64/65). No `EXTERN`, `KEEP`,
dummy calls, or source/linker workaround will be added.

### Root cause

The verification plan's A0 gate required both `arm_ramvec_initialize()` and
`arm_ramvec_attach()` to link exactly once. However, `arm_ramvec_attach()` has no call
site in A0 — its first explicit caller appears only in A1 runtime repair (plan lines
109–118). Linker `--gc-sections` correctly discards the unreferenced function. This is a
**plan defect**, not an implementation or build defect.

### Corrected A0 gate

The corrected A0 verification gate requires only:

- `CONFIG_ARCH_HAVE_CUSTOM_VECTORS=y` and `CONFIG_ARCH_RAMVECTORS=y`;
- `.ram_vectors` is `SHT_NOBITS`/NOLOAD, `0x100` bytes, at `0x28000800`, 512-byte aligned;
- `_sram_vectors`/`g_ram_vectors`/`_eram_vectors` span agrees (`0x100`);
- `arm_ramvec_initialize()` links exactly once;
- flash `_vectors` at `0x02010000`, size `0x108` (66 entries);
- raw magic `42 4b 37 32 33 36 00 00` at image offset `0x100`;
- image below `0x100000` partition gate.

`arm_ramvec_attach()` is NOT required in A0. Its presence becomes an A1 gate after the
explicit slot 64/65 runtime repair calls are added.

### No rebuild needed

The gate correction is a plan-only change. No source, config, defconfig, linker script,
or SDK file was modified. The clean rebuild from the prior entry (distclean + rebuild,
exit 0, `all-app.bin` = 235,558 bytes) remains the authoritative build. No additional
rebuild was performed.

### Corrected A0 artifact evidence (from clean rebuild)

| Gate | Detail |
|---|---|
| Config | `CONFIG_ARCH_HAVE_CUSTOM_VECTORS=y`, `CONFIG_ARCH_HAVE_RAMVECTORS=y`, `CONFIG_ARCH_RAMVECTORS=y` |
| RAM section | `.ram_vectors` exactly once, type `SHT_NOBITS` (NOLOAD), address `0x28000800`, size `0x100`, 512-byte aligned |
| Symbol span | `_sram_vectors=0x28000800`, `g_ram_vectors` size `0x100` (OBJECT, BSS), `_eram_vectors=0x28000900` |
| arm_ramvec_initialize | Exactly one definition at `0x020107f0`, 48 bytes |
| arm_ramvec_attach | Absent from ELF — expected in A0; deferred to A1 gate |
| Flash vectors | `_vectors` at `0x02010000`, symbol size `0x108` (264 bytes, 66 entries) |
| Magic bytes | Exact raw bytes `42 4b 37 32 33 36 00 00` (`BK7236\0\0`) at `nuttx.bin+0x100` |
| Partition | `nuttx.bin` = 156,436 bytes (`0x26314`) < `0x100000` partition gate |
| Packaging | `app_burn_offset=0x11000`, combined magic offset `0x11110`, all-app.bin = 235,558 bytes |

### Status

`build-verified`. Not `board-verified`. No flash, board test, commit, or push was
performed.

### Next single minimal action

Obtain separate flash authorization, then verify VTOR points to `g_ram_vectors`,
slots 15/31 contain `exception_common`, UART/NSH work, `T/K` present, no WDT reset,
and LittleFS reads `BK7258LFS-OK`. Do not start A1 or SDK bridge before board
verification.

## 2026-07-22 — A0 board observation: boot baseline passes; VTOR/slot proof pending

### J-Link session

```text
J-Link> mem32 0x28000800 4
0x28000800 = 0x2809FFFC 0x02010129 0x02010119 0x02010119
```

J-Link connected via SWD, identified STAR r1p0. J-Link warned that the
configured Cortex-M33 does not match the identified STAR, and warned that old
J-Link firmware may not handle I/D cache correctly. These are informational
warnings from the J-Link software; no functional impact was observed from the
warnings alone.

### Serial boot evidence

```text
bootloader entered
app partition 0x02010000
jump 0x02010000
N4Clk tier 5 / M1 0x420 / hz 0x1312d000
ABWT
NuttShell (NSH)
K
```

UART/NSH accepted `cat /data/probe.txt` and produced output `BK7258LFS-OK`.

### Debugger-connection-correlated reset observation

The target reboots when J-Link establishes the connection. Without that
connection-induced event the shown firmware boots normally. This is recorded as
a debugger-connection-correlated reset observation, not yet as a WDT or firmware
regression root cause. J-Link connect warning/reset may perturb the board and
needs a minimal follow-up after connection; do not conclude firmware
spontaneously resets.

### PASS / board-observed evidence

| Item | Status | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Bootloader accepts image | PASS | bootloader entered, app partition `0x02010000`, jump `0x02010000` |
| Reaches NSH | PASS | `ABWT` markers, `NuttShell (NSH)` prompt, `K` automonitor marker |
| UART RX / command path | PASS | `cat /data/probe.txt` accepted and executed |
| LittleFS persistent file | PASS | output `BK7258LFS-OK` |
| WDT automonitor markers | PASS | `ABWT` then `K` observed; no spontaneous 8-second reset during the shown boot |
| RAM-vector base plausible | PASS | `mem32 0x28000800 4` reads `0x2809FFFC 0x02010129 0x02010119 0x02010119`; values are plausible copied initial vector entries, not zero-fill or `0xAA` SRAM fill |

### NOT yet proven / pending evidence

| Item | Status | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| VTOR points to RAM | NOT PROVEN | VTOR register `0xE000ED08` was not read; the command read `mem32 0x28000800 4`, not the VTOR register itself |
| Slot 15 (SysTick) value | NOT PROVEN | RAM address `0x2800083C` (slot 15) was not read |
| Slot 31 value | NOT PROVEN | RAM address `0x2800087C` (slot 31) was not read |

### Status and evidence boundary

A0 remains `build-verified` with partial board evidence. The boot baseline
(bootloader jump, NSH prompt, UART RX, WDT markers, LittleFS read, plausible
RAM-vector contents) all pass. However, the three critical RAM-vector proof
points — VTOR register value, slot 15 content, and slot 31 content — have not
been read. Therefore A0 is NOT yet `board-verified`.

The debugger-connection-correlated reset observation is noted but does not
constitute proof of a firmware spontaneous reset. The board boots normally
without J-Link connection; the reset occurs when J-Link establishes SWD.

### Next single minimal action

While J-Link is already connected and the board has returned to NSH, read VTOR
(`0xE000ED08`) plus RAM slots 15 (`0x2800083C`) and 31 (`0x2800087C`). Do not
flash or enter A1.

### Static artifact evidence from clean-rebuild ELF/raw image

The following static values were extracted from the current `build-verified`
clean-rebuild ELF and `nuttx.bin`. These are build-artifact evidence only;
actual runtime values remain pending J-Link reads while the board is at NSH.

| Item | Static artifact value |
|---|---|
| `exception_common` (ELF symbol) | `0x0201084c` |
| Thumb-bit stored vector pointer | `0x0201084d` (bit 0 set for Thumb) |
| `nuttx.bin` raw slot 15 at offset `0x3c` | `0x0201084d` |
| `nuttx.bin` raw slot 31 at offset `0x7c` | `0x0201084d` |

The hardware vector pointers in the raw binary carry the Thumb bit (bit 0 set),
as required by the Cortex-M33 vector table specification. Both slot 15 (SysTick)
and slot 31 in the flash image contain the same `exception_common` entry.

### Expected runtime values (pending J-Link reads)

While J-Link is already connected and the board has returned to NSH, the
following reads are expected to confirm runtime RAM-vector relocation:

| J-Link command | Expected result | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `mem32 0xE000ED08 1` | `0x28000800` | VTOR points to RAM vector base |
| `mem32 0x2800083C 1` | `0x0201084D` | RAM slot 15 (SysTick) contains `exception_common` with Thumb bit |
| `mem32 0x2800087C 1` | `0x0201084D` | RAM slot 31 contains `exception_common` with Thumb bit |

These expected values are derived from static artifact analysis. If the actual
runtime reads match, A0 RAM-vector relocation can be promoted to
`board-verified`. If they differ, the discrepancy must be diagnosed before
proceeding.

Status: remains `build-verified` with partial board evidence; not
`board-verified`.

## 2026-07-22 — A0 RAM-vector relocation board verification complete

### Objective

Record the final J-Link VTOR and RAM-slot reads that complete A0 RAM-vector
relocation board verification, combining them with the immediately preceding
boot-baseline evidence.

### J-Link runtime reads (board at NSH, J-Link connected)

```text
J-Link> mem32 0xE000ED08 1
E000ED08 = 28000800

J-Link> mem32 0x2800083C 1
2800083C = 0201084D

J-Link> mem32 0x2800087C 1
2800087C = 0201084D
```

### Runtime-to-artifact match

| Item | Runtime read | Static artifact expectation | Match |
|---|---|---|---|
| VTOR (`0xE000ED08`) | `0x28000800` | `g_ram_vectors` at `0x28000800` | PASS |
| Slot 15 (`0x2800083C`) | `0x0201084D` | `exception_common` (`0x0201084c`) with Thumb bit set | PASS |
| Slot 31 (`0x2800087C`) | `0x0201084D` | `exception_common` (`0x0201084c`) with Thumb bit set | PASS |

All three runtime reads exactly match the clean-rebuild ELF and raw-image
expectations. The Cortex-M33 VTOR points to the RAM vector base at
`0x28000800`, and RAM slots 15 (SysTick) and 31 contain the correct
`exception_common|1` Thumb entry.

### Combined board evidence (preceding boot baseline + J-Link reads)

| Item | Status | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Bootloader accepts image | PASS | bootloader entered, app partition `0x02010000`, jump `0x02010000` |
| Reaches NSH | PASS | `ABWT` markers, `NuttShell (NSH)` prompt, `K` automonitor marker |
| UART RX / command path | PASS | `cat /data/probe.txt` accepted and executed |
| LittleFS persistent file | PASS | output `BK7258LFS-OK` |
| WDT automonitor markers | PASS | `ABWT` then `K` observed; no spontaneous 8-second reset during the shown run |
| VTOR points to RAM | PASS | `0xE000ED08` reads `0x28000800` |
| Slot 15 (SysTick) | PASS | `0x2800083C` reads `0x0201084D` (`exception_common|1`) |
| Slot 31 | PASS | `0x2800087C` reads `0x0201084D` (`exception_common|1`) |

### Tooling caveat: J-Link connection-correlated reset

J-Link V9 establishes SWD as STAR r1p0. The J-Link software reports that the
configured Cortex-M33 does not match the identified STAR and warns that old
J-Link firmware may not handle I/D cache correctly. Additionally, the target
reboots when J-Link establishes the SWD connection. This is recorded as a
**debugger-connection-correlated reset / tooling caveat**, not as an A0 or WDT
regression. After reconnection and reboot, the runtime reads shown above are
correct and match expectations. The warnings are informational J-Link software
messages; no functional impact was observed from the warnings alone.

### Status

`board-verified`. A0 RAM-vector relocation is complete: VTOR points to RAM,
RAM vector slots contain the correct `exception_common` entries, boot baseline
passes (bootloader jump, NSH, UART RX, WDT automonitor, LittleFS), and no
firmware-spontaneous reset is observed in the shown run.

### Action boundary

- No agent-performed flash, download, commit, or push occurred.
- All flashing/download remains user-only.
- The next allowed technical action is A1 adaptation from the governing plan
  (explicit slot 64/65 runtime repair calls, `arm_ramvec_attach` A1 gate).
- SDK IRQ bridge is not started and remains gated behind A1.
- `A/B/W/T/K` diagnostic markers and the unused SysTick probe remain pending
  final cleanup after IRQ behavior is stable.

## 2026-07-22 — A1 RED compile/link invariant gates installed

### Objective

Install test-first (TDD RED) compile-time and link-time invariants that express
the expected A1 IRQ facts, without changing the current production A0 IRQ
definitions, 66-entry flash vector table, or runtime initialization behavior.

### Invariants added

#### `board/bk7258_t5ai/chip/include/irq.h` — compile-time gates

| Invariant | Expected A1 value | Current A0 value | Gate mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| `NR_IRQS` | 80 | 48 | `_Static_assert(NR_IRQS == 80)` |
| `ARM_VECTAB_SIZE` | 80 | 64 (=16+48) | `_Static_assert(ARM_VECTAB_SIZE == 80)` |
| External IRQ count | 64 | 48 | Checked via NR_IRQS assertion |
| Runtime vector alignment | 512 | 512 | Linker ASSERT (existing) |
| ETHERNET anchor | NuttX IRQ 64 | undefined | `_Static_assert(BK7258_IRQ_ETHERNET == 64)` |
| SCALE0 anchor | NuttX IRQ 65 | undefined | `_Static_assert(BK7258_IRQ_SCALE0 == 65)` |
| MAILBOX anchor | NuttX IRQ 79 | undefined | `_Static_assert(BK7258_IRQ_MAILBOX == 79)` |
| SMP rejection | CPU0-only | CPU0-only | `#error` if `CONFIG_SMP` set |
| Boot magic offset 0 | 0x100 | 0x100 | `_Static_assert(BK7258_MAGIC_BOOT0_OFFSET == 0x100)` |
| Boot magic offset 1 | 0x104 | 0x104 | `_Static_assert(BK7258_MAGIC_BOOT1_OFFSET == 0x104)` |

New macros defined: `BK7258_IRQ_ETHERNET`, `BK7258_IRQ_SCALE0`,
`BK7258_IRQ_MAILBOX`, `BK7258_A1_EXTERNAL_IRQ_COUNT`, `BK7258_A1_NR_IRQS`,
`ARM_VECTAB_SIZE` (guarded), `BK7258_MAGIC_BOOT0_OFFSET`,
`BK7258_MAGIC_BOOT1_OFFSET`, `BK7258_MAGIC_BOOT_SIZE`.

#### `board/bk7258_t5ai/scripts/ld.script` — linker ASSERT gates

| Invariant | Expected A1 value | Current A0 value | Gate mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| `.vectors` section size | 0x140 | 0x108 | `ASSERT(. - ORIGIN(FLASH) == 0x140)` |
| Flash `_vectors` start | 0x02010000 | 0x02010000 | `. = ORIGIN(FLASH)` (unchanged) |
| `.ram_vectors` size | 0x140 | 0x100 | `ASSERT(_eram_vectors - _sram_vectors == 0x140)` |
| `.ram_vectors` alignment | 512 | 512 | `ASSERT((_sram_vectors & 0x1ff) == 0)` (unchanged) |
| Magic offset plausibility | >0x100 | 0x108 | `ASSERT(. - ORIGIN(FLASH) > 0x100)` |

### Scope and behavior boundary

- Production `NR_IRQS` (48), `ARMV8M_PERIPHERAL_INTERRUPTS`, vector array
  size/contents, external IRQ definitions, `up_irqinitialize()` sequence, and
  runtime repair calls are **unchanged**.
- The 66-entry flash boot table and mandatory magic at slots 64/65 are
  **unchanged**.
- No SDK IRQ bridge, vector-table expansion, or runtime magic-slot repair was
  implemented.
- No dummy calls, `EXTERN`, dead-code retention, or production workarounds were
  added.

### Status

`static-only`. RED gates are installed. The build is expected to fail on the
newly added A1 invariants (primarily `NR_IRQS == 80` and `.vectors == 0x140`).

### Next single minimal action

Run the authorized build to confirm the RED gates fail as expected.

## 2026-07-22 — A1 RED build result: gates catch missing A1 behavior

### Command and workspace

```text
cd /home/lijian/project/open-vela
./build.sh vendor/openvela/boards/contest2026_135_bk7258/configs/nsh -j8
```

Workspace root: `/home/lijian/project/open-vela`

### Exit code and log

Exit code: **2** (build failure).
Full build log: `/tmp/bk7258-a1-red-build-20260722.log`

### Decisive failure lines

```text
/home/lijian/project/open-vela/nuttx/include/arch/chip/irq.h:112:1: error: static assertion failed: "A1 gate: NR_IRQS must be 80 (16+64 external)"
/home/lijian/project/open-vela/nuttx/include/arch/chip/irq.h:123:1: error: static assertion failed: "A1 gate: ARM_VECTAB_SIZE must be 80"
```

Both errors are from the newly added A1 compile-time invariants in `irq.h`.
No unrelated syntax, environment, or toolchain errors occurred. The build
failed at the first compilation unit that includes `<arch/chip/irq.h>`,
confirming the `_Static_assert` gates fire before any link-time ASSERT could
be reached.

### Conclusion

The RED gates correctly catch the missing A1 behavior. `NR_IRQS` is currently
48 (A0) but the gate requires 80 (A1). `ARM_VECTAB_SIZE` is currently 64
(=16+48) but the gate requires 80. The invariants are functioning as intended:
the build cannot proceed until the A1 production changes expand the IRQ count
to 80 and the vector table to 80 entries.

### Production A0 behavior preserved

The following A0 production values are unchanged and were NOT implemented or
modified:

- `NR_IRQS` remains 48
- `ARMV8M_PERIPHERAL_INTERRUPTS` remains 48
- 66-entry flash vector table and magic at slots 64/65 unchanged
- `up_irqinitialize()` sequence unchanged
- No runtime repair calls added

### Status

`static-only`. RED gates verified. Build fails on A1 invariants as expected.

### Next single minimal action

Implement A1 production changes: expand `NR_IRQS` to 80, extend the vector
table to 80 entries (0x140 bytes), and add runtime repair of boot-magic slots
64/65 via `arm_ramvec_attach`.

---

## 2026-07-22 -- A1 Task 1 v2 correction and re-test

### Reason for correction

Independent review found 5 issues with the v1 RED gates:
- F1 [Critical]: Missing `ARMV8M_PERIPHERAL_INTERRUPTS == 64` gate (now present)
- F2 [Important]: `#ifndef ARM_VECTAB_SIZE` guard in `irq.h` could silently shadow the gate (removed from irq.h; gate now only in bk7258_vectors.c)
- F3 [Important]: Linker `.vectors` magic offset assertion `>0x100` was imprecise (removed; replaced by explicit `_vectors == ORIGIN(FLASH)` + `SIZEOF(.vectors) == 0x140`)
- F4 [Minor]: "82 entries" documentation error (corrected to "80 entries")
- F5 [Minor]: Hardcoded `48` in magic offset assertion (clarified with comment)
- Controller: production IRQ names `BK7258_IRQ_ETHERNET/SCALE0/MAILBOX` removed from public `irq.h`; all value checks moved to `bk7258_vectors.c` with conditional `_Static_assert(0)` branches

### Scope of v2 changes

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `irq.h` | Removed A1 invariants section; kept SMP rejection + boot-magic constants only |
| `bk7258_vectors.c` | Replaced gates: removed `BK7258_A1_VECTAB_SIZE`/`_ALIGN` defs; added `ARMV8M_PERIPHERAL_INTERRUPTS==64`, `ARM_VECTAB_SIZE==80` with `#ifdef` guard, `VECTAB_ALIGN==512`; IRQ anchors use conditional `_Static_assert(0)` branches; no production IRQ name definitions |
| `ld.script` | Unchanged (already correct per v2 requirements) |
| `n6-sdk-integration-worklog.md` | Corrected "82 entries" to "80 entries" (2 locations); appended v2 section |
| `next-stage-prompt.md` | Corrected "82 entries" to "80 entries" (1 location) |

### Build command

```bash
cd /home/lijian/project/open-vela
./build.sh vendor/openvela/boards/contest2026_135_bk7258/configs/nsh -j8
```

### Exit code and log

Exit code: **2** (build failure).
Full build log: `/tmp/bk7258-a1-red-build-20260722-v2.log`

### Decisive failure lines

```text
chip/bk7258_vectors.c:117:3: error: static assertion failed: "A1 gate: BK7258_EXTERNAL_IRQS not defined; expected 64"
chip/bk7258_vectors.c:121:1: error: static assertion failed: "A1 gate: NR_IRQS must be 80 (16 + 64 external)"
chip/bk7258_vectors.c:124:1: error: static assertion failed: "A1 gate: ARMV8M_PERIPHERAL_INTERRUPTS must be 64 (external IRQ count)"
chip/bk7258_vectors.c:129:1: error: static assertion failed: "A1 gate: vector table must be 80 entries (0x140 bytes)"
chip/bk7258_vectors.c:138:3: error: static assertion failed: "A1 gate: ARM_VECTAB_SIZE must be 80"
chip/bk7258_vectors.c:154:3: error: static assertion failed: "A1 gate: BK7258_IRQ_ETHERNET not defined; expected 64"
chip/bk7258_vectors.c:162:3: error: static assertion failed: "A1 gate: BK7258_IRQ_SCALE0 not defined; expected 65"
chip/bk7258_vectors.c:170:3: error: static assertion failed: "A1 gate: BK7258_IRQ_MAILBOX not defined; expected 79"
```

All 8 errors are from the v2 RED gates in `bk7258_vectors.c`. No syntax, environment, or toolchain errors. No errors from `irq.h` (production IRQ names removed). No errors from linker (compilation fails first).

### Conclusion

The v2 RED gates correctly catch all missing A1 behavior. All 8 gates fire from
`bk7258_vectors.c` (not from irq.h or ld.script). The gates express every
required A1 invariant: external count=64, NR_IRQS=80, ARMV8M_PERIPHERAL_INTERRUPTS=64,
ARM_VECTAB_SIZE=80, VECTAB_ALIGN=512, anchor IRQs 64/65/79, magic offsets 0x100/0x104.

### Production A0 behavior preserved (unchanged from v1)

- `NR_IRQS` remains 48
- `ARMV8M_PERIPHERAL_INTERRUPTS` remains 48
- 66-entry flash vector table and magic at slots 64/65 unchanged
- `up_irqinitialize()` sequence unchanged
- No runtime repair calls added

### Status

`static-only`. v2 RED gates verified. Build fails on A1 invariants as expected.

### Next single minimal action

Independent re-review of v2 gates, then implement A1 production changes.

---

## 2026-07-22 -- A1 Task 1 v2 review verdict

### Review result

Independent read-only review of v2 RED gates: **Spec: PASS**, **Quality: APPROVED**.
All 5 prior findings (F1-F5 from v1 review) verified resolved. Three Minor
non-blocking observations noted for Task 2 cleanup only:

| # | Severity | Description | Task 2 action |
|---|---|---|---|
| v2-F1 | Minor | Tautological `_Static_assert(512 == 512)` adds zero gate value (real alignment gate is linker ASSERT at ld.script:152-153) | Remove from bk7258_vectors.c:145-146; do not weaken linker gate |
| v2-F2 | Minor | Comment at bk7258_vectors.c:132-134 inaccurately says `ARM_VECTAB_SIZE` is defined in `arch/arm_m/irq.h` as `(16 + NR_IRQS)`; actual source is `arch/arm/src/arm_m/ram_vectors.h` as `(ARMV8M_PERIPHERAL_INTERRUPTS + NVIC_IRQ_FIRST)` | Fix comment; gate value itself is correct |
| v2-F3 | Minor | Duplicate `_Static_assert(NR_IRQS == 80)` at lines 121 and 129 | Remove duplicate at line 129; keep line 121 |

### Review evidence

- Spec compliance matrix: all 12 brief requirements have correct gates
- Production A0 behavior preserved: NR_IRQS=48, ARMV8M_PERIPHERAL_INTERRUPTS=48, 66-entry table, up_irqinitialize() unchanged, no runtime repair calls
- No future production macros defined by RED tests
- ARM_VECTAB_SIZE semantics verified: 16 + 64 = 80 (not 16 + 80 = 96)
- Linker ASSERTs valid GNU ld syntax, correctly placed after section definitions
- File scope: only approved 7 files touched; chip.h and bk7258_irq.c unchanged from baseline

### Status

`static-only`. Task 1 RED gates accepted. Ready for Task 2 minimal GREEN implementation.

### Next single minimal action

Implement A1 production changes (Task 2 GREEN): expand `NR_IRQS` to 80 (16+64), set `ARMV8M_PERIPHERAL_INTERRUPTS` to 64, extend vector table to 80 entries (0x140 bytes), add runtime repair of boot-magic slots 64/65 via `arm_ramvec_attach`. Clean up three Minor notes during refactor only if doing so does not weaken gates.

## 2026-07-22 -- A1 Task 2 minimal GREEN source implementation

### Objective

Implement the minimum A1 production behavior needed to satisfy the accepted
Task 1 RED gates and the required runtime-vector repair, per
`/tmp/bk7258-a1-task2-brief.md`.

### Source changes

### Binding production definitions implemented

```c
#define BK7258_IRQ_FIRST                16
#define BK7258_EXTERNAL_IRQS            64
#define NR_IRQS                         (BK7258_IRQ_FIRST + BK7258_EXTERNAL_IRQS)  /* = 80 */
#define BK7258_IRQ_UART1                (BK7258_IRQ_FIRST + 15) /* logical 31 */
#define BK7258_IRQ_ETHERNET             (BK7258_IRQ_FIRST + 48) /* logical 64 */
#define BK7258_IRQ_SCALE0               (BK7258_IRQ_FIRST + 49) /* logical 65 */
#define BK7258_IRQ_MAILBOX              (BK7258_IRQ_FIRST + 63) /* logical 79 */
#define ARMV8M_PERIPHERAL_INTERRUPTS    BK7258_EXTERNAL_IRQS    /* = 64 */
```

Resulting common ARM relationships:
- `BK7258_EXTERNAL_IRQS` = 64
- `NR_IRQS` = 16 + 64 = 80
- `ARMV8M_PERIPHERAL_INTERRUPTS` = 64
- `ARM_VECTAB_SIZE` = 16 + 64 = 80
- `VECTAB_ALIGN` = 512

### Binding flash vector layout implemented

```text
[0]       initial MSP
[1]       __start
[2..3]    bk7258_hardfault_handler (diagnostic)
[4..63]   exception_common
[64]      BK7258_APP_MAGIC_WORD0 (raw offset 0x100)
[65]      BK7258_APP_MAGIC_WORD1 (raw offset 0x104)
[66..79]  exception_common
```

80 entries, 0x140 bytes. Slots 64/65 are inside the table.

### Binding `up_irqinitialize()` ordering implemented

1. Disable all 64 external NVIC lines (loop bound `BK7258_EXTERNAL_IRQS`).
2. Point VTOR at flash `_vectors`.
3. `UP_DSB(); UP_ISB();` after VTOR write.
4. `arm_ramvec_initialize()` copies all 80 entries and switches VTOR to `g_ram_vectors`.
5. `arm_ramvec_attach(BK7258_IRQ_ETHERNET, exception_common)` and
   `arm_ramvec_attach(BK7258_IRQ_SCALE0, exception_common)`.
6. Both return values checked; failure calls `PANIC()`.
7. `UP_DSB(); UP_ISB();` after the two RAM slot writes.
8. Debug assertions: `getreg32(NVIC_VECTAB) == g_ram_vectors`,
   `g_ram_vectors[64] == (exception_common | 1)`,
   `g_ram_vectors[65] == (exception_common | 1)`.
9. Continue default priorities, system-handler attachments, IRQ stack
   coloring, and `up_irq_enable()`.

No interrupt unmasked between flash VTOR write and completed slot 64/65 repair.

### Three Minor review notes resolved

| # | Action | Gate impact |
|---|---|---|
| v2-F1 | Replaced `_Static_assert(512 == 512)` with `_Static_assert(VECTAB_ALIGN == 512, ...)` under `#ifdef VECTAB_ALIGN` | No weakening; genuine gate |
| v2-F2 | Fixed comment: ARM_VECTAB_SIZE source is `ram_vectors.h` as `(ARMV8M_PERIPHERAL_INTERRUPTS + NVIC_IRQ_FIRST)`, not `arch/arm_m/irq.h` | Comment-only |
| v2-F3 | Removed duplicate `_Static_assert(NR_IRQS == 80)` (kept the one at the core IRQ count gates section) | No weakening; one assertion retained |

### Additional change: `board/bk7258_t5ai/chip/chip.h` (internal)

The arch-level chip.h (`nuttx/arch/arm/src/chip/chip.h`, symlink to
`board/bk7258_t5ai/chip/chip.h`) also defined `ARMV8M_PERIPHERAL_INTERRUPTS`
as `NR_IRQS`. Since `arm_internal.h` includes this file after the public
`chip/include/chip.h`, its definition would override ours, producing
`ARM_VECTAB_SIZE` = 80+16 = 96 instead of the required 80. Changed to
`BK7258_EXTERNAL_IRQS` (64). Added `#ifndef` guard in the public chip.h to
prevent preprocessor redefinition warning.

### Status

`build-verified`. Source changes complete. GREEN build passed (exit 0). No
flash, board test, commit, or push performed. Board status remains as A0
`board-verified`; A1 is NOT board-verified.

### Next single minimal action

Task 2 independent review. Then Task 3 artifact inspection.

```

### Compilation warnings

Zero `ARMV8M_PERIPHERAL_INTERRUPTS` redefinition warnings (the `#ifndef`
guard in the public chip.h prevents them). Zero `error:` lines. The only
warnings are from SDK headers (`CONFIG_SOC_BK7257` not defined) which are
pre-existing and unrelated.

### Evidence boundary

This result proves compilation, linking, CRC expansion, and packaging completed
without error. All accepted RED gates (static assertions and linker ASSERTs)
passed. No artifact inspection (ELF symbols, `.ram_vectors` size, config
symbols) has been performed yet.

### Status

`build-verified`. Not `board-verified`. No flash, board test, commit, or push
was performed.

## 2026-07-22 -- A1 Task 2 review findings and fixes

### Independent review verdict

- **Spec: PASS**
- **Quality: APPROVED**

### Findings

| # | Severity | File | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 [Important] | Quality | `bk7258_irq.c:200-201` | Cast LHS to `(uintptr_t)` and use anchor indices `BK7258_IRQ_ETHERNET`/`BK7258_IRQ_SCALE0` |
| F2 [Important] | Scope | `chip/chip.h` (internal) | Accepted by controller; technically required by dual include paths; team-overlay owned |
| F3 [Minor] | Quality | `chip/include/chip.h` | Add `#elif ARMV8M_PERIPHERAL_INTERRUPTS != BK7258_EXTERNAL_IRQS #error` |
| F4 [Minor] | Cosmetic | `bk7258_vectors.c:6` | "Stage N2" -> "Stage A1" |

### Controller scope adjudication

The extra `board/bk7258_t5ai/chip/chip.h` change is accepted and added to
Task-2 scope because it is technically required by the dual include paths, is
team-overlay-owned, and the human's higher-level authorization is overlay-only
A1 source changes. The original task brief's file list was incomplete; do not
revert this required macro fix.

### Exact fixes applied

1. `bk7258_irq.c`: `(uintptr_t)g_ram_vectors[BK7258_IRQ_ETHERNET] == ((uintptr_t)exception_common | 1u)` and same for `BK7258_IRQ_SCALE0`. Eliminates pointer/integer comparison warning.
2. `chip/include/chip.h`: `#ifndef` define plus `#elif ARMV8M_PERIPHERAL_INTERRUPTS != BK7258_EXTERNAL_IRQS #error`. Does not silently accept wrong prior value.
3. Comments corrected:
   - `bk7258_vectors.c` header: "Stage N2" -> "Stage A1".
   - `bk7258_vectors.c` assertions: "RED gates" -> "permanent A1 compile-time invariants"; removed false "current A0 definitions differ" text.
   - `irq.h`: slots 64/65 correspond to external IRQ indices 48/49 but logical NuttX IRQs 64/65.
   - `ld.script`: header "Stage N1" -> "Stage A1"; "66 entries, 0x108 bytes" -> "80 entries, 0x140 bytes"; gate comments describe current A1 state.
   - `bk7258_irq.c` header: accurately notes diagnostic slots [2..3] and runtime-repaired [64]/[65].

### Status

`build-verified` (pending rebuild to confirm F1 warnings gone). Not
`board-verified`. No flash, commit, or push.

### Next single minimal action

Rebuild to confirm F1 pointer/integer warnings are eliminated.

### Exit code and log

Exit code: **0** (success).
Full build log: `/tmp/bk7258-a1-green-build-20260722-v2.log`

### Observed output

```text
nuttx.bin       = 156604 bytes
nuttx_crc.bin   = 166396 bytes
bl_crc.bin      = 69632 bytes (physical 0x0 .. 0x69631)
all-app.bin     = 236028 bytes (= bl_crc.bin + nuttx_crc.bin)
```

### Warning scan

- `comparison between pointer and integer`: **0** (F1 confirmed fixed)
- `ARMV8M_PERIPHERAL_INTERRUPTS.*redefined`: **0** (F3 confirmed fixed)
- `error:`: **0**
- All remaining warnings are from SDK headers (`CONFIG_SOC_BK7257`, etc.) -- pre-existing, unrelated.

### Evidence boundary

Build exit 0 with zero team-file errors and zero F1 pointer/integer warnings.
No artifact inspection, flash, board test, commit, or push performed.

### Status

`build-verified`. Not `board-verified`. No flash, commit, or push.

### Next single minimal action

Task 2 re-review. Then Task 3 artifact inspection.

---

## 2026-07-22 -- A1 Task 2 re-review acceptance

Task 2 re-review complete: **Spec PASS**, **Quality APPROVED**, **0 remaining findings**. All F1-F4 resolved. v2 build exit 0 with sizes unchanged (`nuttx.bin`=156604 B, `all-app.bin`=236028 B) and zero team-file warnings.

A1 is `build-verified` / `static-only`, NOT `board-verified`. No flash, no commit, no bridge.

### Next single minimal action

Task 3 static artifact inspection.

---

## 2026-07-22 -- A1 Task 3 static artifact verification (RETRACTED -- see adversarial review below)

Initial verifier run produced a false 23/23 PASS claim. Adversarial review found the verifier hardcodes symbol addresses, has unconditional always-PASS gates (G09/G12/G19/G21/G23), incomplete source-boundary checks (G22 only checks nuttx/), and a critical postbuild script hex/decimal formatting bug producing fabricated offsets `0x69888`/`0x69631`. The unqualified 23/23 acceptance is retracted. Status is `blocked` pending corrected verifier RED run and postbuild fix.

### Adversarial review

- **File**: `/tmp/bk7258-a1-task3-review.md`
- **Spec: FAIL** (postbuild script emits decimal-as-hex physical offsets)
- **Quality: CHANGES_REQUIRED** (4 Important findings: hardcoded values, vacuous G16, incomplete G22, unconditional gates)

### Findings requiring correction

| # | Severity | Finding |
|---|----------|---------|
| F1 | Critical | `postbuild.sh` prints `0x$((BL_SIZE - 1))` = `0x69631` (decimal disguised as hex); actual hex `0x10FFF`. Same bug on magic offset: `0x$((BL_SIZE + 0x100))` = `0x69888`; correct CRC-expanded value is `0x11110`. |
| F2 | Critical | Verifier hardcodes `EXCEPTION_COMMON`, `START_ADDR`, `HARDFAULT_ADDR`, `RAM_VECTORS_ADDR` instead of deriving from current ELF. |
| F3 | Critical | G22 only checks `nuttx/` for official-tree diffs; ignores `apps/`, `frameworks/`, `packages/`, `external/`, `vendor/`. |
| F4 | Important | G15 hardcodes `up_irqinitialize` function address range. |
| F5 | Important | G16 `irq_attach` operand extraction can silently fail (vacuous pass). |
| F6 | Important | G09/G12/G19/G21/G23 are unconditional always-PASS stubs. |
| F7 | Minor | G16 label conflates SVCall and HardFault (both labeled "SVCall/HardFault"). |

### Pre-fix snapshots

- postbuild.sh hash: `4fe752745f3ebbfdd980673cc8355a9476dd5f99e05a06de83126bae992da799`
- Overlay manifest: `/tmp/bk7258-a1-task3-prefix-manifest.txt`
- Docs hashes: `/tmp/bk7258-a1-task3-prefix-docs-hash.txt`

### Next single minimal action

Correct verifier (dynamic derivation, real predicates, expanded source checks) then run RED against v2 artifacts. Expect 22/23 (postbuild offset gate fails). Then fix postbuild.sh, rebuild v3, run GREEN.

---

## 2026-07-22 -- A1 Task 3 RED run (corrected verifier, v2 artifacts)

Corrected verifier (all symbols derived dynamically from ELF, no hardcoded addresses, real predicates on all 23 gates, expanded source checks, postbuild log cross-check) run against v2 build artifacts and v2 build log.

### Command

```
python3 /tmp/bk7258-a1-verify-artifacts.py 2>&1 | tee /tmp/bk7258-a1-task3-verify-v2-red.log
```

### Result: 22/23 PASS, 1 FAIL

- **G20 FAIL**: Postbuild log physical offsets are decimal-masquerading-as-hex.
  - `bl_crc.bin` end: log says `0x69631` (decimal 69631 with `0x` prefix), actual hex = `0x10FFF`
  - Magic offset: log says `0x69888` (decimal 69888 with `0x` prefix), actual file offset = `0x11110`
  - Decisive mismatch confirmed by dynamic byte search in all-app.bin.

All other 22 gates PASS with genuine predicates (dynamic symbol derivation, cross-checks, operand extraction, source boundary against all official trees).

### Next action

Fix `postbuild.sh` (decimal-as-hex formatting + CRC-expanded offset formula), rebuild v3, rerun verifier.

---

## 2026-07-22 -- A1 Task 3 postbuild.sh fix

Fixed `postbuild.sh` (team overlay only, no official-tree changes):

1. **Line 87**: `0x$((BL_SIZE - 1))` (decimal-as-hex) replaced with `$(printf '%x' $((BL_SIZE - 1)))` (true hex). For current build: `0x69631` (wrong) becomes `0x10fff` (correct).

2. **Line 90**: `0x$((BL_SIZE + 0x100))` (decimal-as-hex + wrong offset) replaced with `$(printf '0x%x' $((BL_SIZE + 0x110)))` (true hex + CRC-expanded offset). For current build: `0x69888` (wrong) becomes `0x11110` (correct).

3. **Header comment (line 15)**: Updated magic offset claim from `0x11100` to `0x11110` with CRC expansion explanation.

No changes to packaging bytes/concatenation behavior. Build artifacts (bl_crc.bin, nuttx_crc.bin, all-app.bin) remain byte-identical.

### Next action

Rebuild v3, then run corrected verifier against v3 artifacts.

---

## 2026-07-22 -- A1 Task 3 GREEN run (v3 build + verifier)

### v3 build

- Command: `./build.sh vendor/openvela/boards/contest2026_135_bk7258/configs/nsh -j8`
- Log: `/tmp/bk7258-a1-green-build-20260722-v3.log`
- Exit: 0
- Postbuild output now correct:
  - `bl_crc.bin = 69632 bytes (physical 0x0 .. 0x10fff)` (was `0x69631`)
  - `app magic in all-app.bin @ 0x11110 (physical)` (was `0x69888`)
- Artifact sizes unchanged: `nuttx.bin`=156604 B, `all-app.bin`=236028 B
- Build artifacts have new SHA-256 hashes vs v2 (NuttX builds embed timestamps; expected). Postbuild packaging semantics/concatenation unchanged. Only v3 hashes are final.

### v3 verifier (GREEN)

- Command: `python3 /tmp/bk7258-a1-verify-artifacts.py 2>&1 | tee /tmp/bk7258-a1-task3-verify-v3.log`
- Exit: 0
- **23/23 PASS. STATUS: ALL GATES PASS.**

All gates now have genuine predicates with dynamic ELF derivation:

- **Size**: 236028 bytes (`0x399fc`)
- **SHA-256**: `33f68aa7261ad4e7ae163c2322fef6f64f96c7d0eeb76295816c20238ebc2293`

### Expected VTOR/RAM addresses for J-Link validation

- VTOR: `0x28000800` (g_ram_vectors)
- RAM slot 64 (`0x28000900`): expect `0x020108fd` (exception_common | 1)
- RAM slot 65 (`0x28000904`): expect `0x020108fd` (exception_common | 1)

### Status

`build-verified` / `static-only`. NOT `board-verified`. No flash, commit, or push.

### Concerns

None from initial F1-F8. Re-review identified 4 residual findings (R1-R4); all closed in subsequent fix pass.

### Next single minimal action

Close R1-R4 (fail-closed G20, report correction, G22/G23 wording), positive+negative tests, then final Task-3 re-review.

---

## 2026-07-22 -- A1 Task 3 re-review residual findings (R1-R4)

Re-review (`/tmp/bk7258-a1-task3-review.md` lines 275-374): **Spec: PASS**, **Quality: CHANGES_REQUIRED**.

| # | Severity | Finding | Status |
|---|----------|---------|--------|
| R1 | Important | G20 WARNING paths do not set `g20_ok = False` (fail-open) | Pending fix |
| R2 | Important | Report "byte-identical to v2" factually wrong (SHA-256 values differ) | Worklog corrected; report pending |
| R3 | Minor | G22 matrix overclaims vendor cleanliness | Worklog corrected; verifier pending |
| R4 | Minor | G23 manifest blind spot for post-snapshot new tracked files | Pending fix |

### R1-R4 closure evidence

**R1 (G20 fail-closed)**: Fixed. Both `else` branches in G20 now set `g20_ok = False` and print `FAIL:` instead of `WARNING:`. Negative test confirms: with postbuild offset lines removed from log, G20 FAILs and verifier exits nonzero.

**R2 (report "byte-identical")**: Fixed. Report and worklog now state: "v3 rebuild produced new artifact hashes (NuttX builds embed timestamps; expected). Only v3 hashes are final."

**R3 (G22 vendor overclaim)**: Fixed. Gate description now reads "5 git-based official trees verified clean; vendor repo-managed (not independently verified)". Vendor status explicitly labeled unverified.

**R4 (G23 tracked-file blind spot)**: Fixed. G23 now compares current `git ls-files` path set against manifest paths; new tracked files after snapshot are flagged unless in allowed list.

### Positive test (v4)

- Command: `python3 /tmp/bk7258-a1-verify-artifacts.py 2>&1 | tee /tmp/bk7258-a1-task3-verify-v4.log`
- Exit: 0
- Result: 23/23 PASS
- Final firmware hash unchanged: `33f68aa7261ad4e7ae163c2322fef6f64f96c7d0eeb76295816c20238ebc2293`

### Negative test (missing postbuild offsets)

- Created `/tmp/bk7258-a1-green-build-20260722-v3-missing-offsets.log` (v3 log with both physical-offset lines removed; mtime preserved)
- Command: `BK7258_A1_BUILD_LOG=/tmp/bk7258-a1-green-build-20260722-v3-missing-offsets.log python3 /tmp/bk7258-a1-verify-artifacts.py 2>&1 | tee /tmp/bk7258-a1-task3-verify-missing-offsets-negative.log`
- Exit: 1 (via `PIPESTATUS[0]`; `tee` itself exits 0)
- Result: 22/23 PASS, G20 FAIL: "FAIL: bl_crc physical end not found in build log" + "FAIL: magic offset not found in build log"
- Confirms fail-closed behavior.

### All R1-R4 closed. Status

`build-verified` / `static-only`. NOT `board-verified`. No flash, commit, or push.

### Next single minimal action

Final Task-3 re-review.

---

## 2026-07-22 -- A1 Task 3 final re-review acceptance

Final re-review (`/tmp/bk7258-a1-task3-review.md`): **Spec: PASS**, **Quality: APPROVED**, **0 findings**.

All prior findings (F1-F8 initial, R1-R4 residual) fully resolved. No remaining defects.

### Evidence summary

### Status

`build-verified` / `static-only`. NOT `board-verified`. No flash, commit, or push.

### Next single minimal action

Final read-only A1 review + user-only flashing/J-Link handoff.

---

## 2026-07-22 -- A1 Task 4 final whole-A1 review and user board handoff

### Final review result

Full review: `/tmp/bk7258-a1-final-review.md`

| Verdict | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Ready for user board verification | **YES** |
| Spec | **PASS** |
| Quality | **APPROVED** |
| Critical findings | 0 |
| Important findings | 0 |
| Minor findings | 3 (all deferred) |

### Three deferred Minor findings

| # | Description | Deferral reason |
|---|-------------|-----------------|
| 1 | A few comments conflate external IRQ indices with logical NuttX/vector-slot numbers (e.g. `irq.h:17-20` says slots 64/65 occupy "logical IRQ numbers 48 and 49"; they are external indices 48/49 but logical NuttX IRQs/vector slots 64/65) | Comment-only; production macros, repair calls, disassembly operands, and ELF/binary layout use correct logical values |
| 2 | Magic-slot compile-time arithmetic checks are not mechanically tied to actual array designators (`bk7258_vectors.c:180-186` vs `:316-320`) | Future-regression hardening issue only; linker gates the real vector base/size; current ELF/binary independently prove magic is in slots 64/65 |
| 3 | Verifier source-boundary gates are not universally fail-closed (`git diff` return codes ignored; untracked files not included) | Does not invalidate current result; independent review found zero tracked official-tree changes; vendor/nested repo coverage caveat already disclosed by G22 |

All three deliberately deferred so the exact reviewed artifact is not changed before board testing.

### Corrected handoff evidence

Full corrected procedure: `/tmp/bk7258-a1-board-handoff-evidence.md`

### Immutable firmware identity (do not rebuild before testing)

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Path | `/home/lijian/project/open-vela/nuttx/all-app.bin` |
| Size | 236028 bytes (`0x399fc`) |
| SHA-256 | `33f68aa7261ad4e7ae163c2322fef6f64f96c7d0eeb76295816c20238ebc2293` |
| Composition | 69632-byte `bl_crc.bin` + 166396-byte `nuttx_crc.bin` |

### User-only BKFIL command template

Derived for full image from the documented `@offset-length` template:

```bat
bk_loader.exe download -p <COM> -b 6000000 --uart-type OTHER --mainBin-multi <path-to>\all-app.bin@0x0-0x399fc --reboot 1 --fast-link 1
```

### ROM mode entry

Hold BOOT button while powering on or pressing RESET.

### Post-flash UART expectations

- Port: UART1, 460800 8N1
- Expected boot sequence: `jump 0x02010000`, `ABWT`, `NuttShell (NSH)`, `K`
- Expected NSH output: `cat /data/probe.txt` -> `BK7258LFS-OK`
- Stability: no spontaneous reset for 30+ seconds

### J-Link validation (after board returns to NSH)

J-Link connection may trigger a tooling-correlated reboot. Wait until board returns to NSH, then:

| Command | Expected value |
|---------|---------------|
| `mem32 0xE000ED08 1` | `0x28000800` |
| `mem32 0x02010100 2` | `0x32374b42 0x00003633` |
| `mem32 0x2800083c 1` | `0x020108fd` |
| `mem32 0x2800087c 1` | `0x020108fd` |
| `mem32 0x28000900 1` | `0x020108fd` |
| `mem32 0x28000904 1` | `0x020108fd` |

- `r` then `h` is bootloader recovery only and must not be used as the state for runtime-vector validation.
- If any value mismatches, stop and diagnose. Do not start SDK IRQ bridge.

### Action boundary

- No agent-performed flash, download, commit, or push occurred.
- Next single minimal action is user flashing and reporting UART/J-Link evidence.
- SDK IRQ bridge remains blocked until A1 is board-verified.
- A1 remains `build-verified` / `static-only`, NOT `board-verified`.

### Final fresh verification after documentation sync

After the Task 4 worklog and next-stage-prompt documentation edits were applied, a fresh verifier run and artifact identity recheck were performed to confirm no artifact drift.

#### Fresh verifier run

```text
python3 /tmp/bk7258-a1-verify-artifacts.py
```

Log: `/tmp/bk7258-a1-task4-final-verify.log`
Exit: **0**
Result: **23/23 PASS**

#### Artifact identity recheck (unchanged)

| Artifact | Size | SHA-256 |
|----------|------|---------|
| ELF `nuttx` | 1432524 B (`0x15dbcc`) | `c2b2f33d7405606850f2e1b7a47b2dacf4548f1fa06f2876742234a2ef3e7278` |
| `nuttx.bin` | 156604 B (`0x263bc`) | `fca3f29963f99f79a8421528dfb835fab687f972e838343e336534c66bac8641` |
| `nuttx_crc.bin` | 166396 B (`0x289fc`) | `bfddbfa07dc9c385516e65738effcd8e0fec3a951865e8402644b914b6277728` |
| `all-app.bin` | 236028 B (`0x399fc`) | `33f68aa7261ad4e7ae163c2322fef6f64f96c7d0eeb76295816c20238ebc2293` |

All four artifacts are byte-identical to the Task 3 v3 build. No rebuild occurred.

#### Tracked-status result

`repo status` and tracked-only `repo forall` exited nonzero because this manifest has pre-existing missing/skipped nested projects and broad untracked noise (apps/testing/drivers/nist-sts, .claude local files, etc.). Among checked projects, tracked changes were listed only in `contest2026_135_yongwangzhiqian`, consistent with overlay-only work.

This does NOT claim universal whole-workspace cleanliness. The reviewer's vendor/skipped-project coverage caveat (Minor finding 3 from the final review) is retained: vendor is repo-managed and not independently verified; skipped nested projects remain outside the checked scope.

#### Status and next action

Unchanged. A1 remains `build-verified` / `static-only`, NOT `board-verified`. No flash, commit, or push. Next single minimal action is user-only BKFIL flashing and UART/J-Link A1 board verification.

## 2026-07-22 -- A1 80-slot RAM-vector board verification complete

### Objective

Record the user-provided UART/boot and J-Link board evidence for the A1
80-slot RAM-vector build (board-flashed `all-app.bin` 236028 B, SHA-256
`a92352eeea5ebbab4eb4a7a95fd97a73d950816a3620242be8e8fc141030b5a5`) and promote A1 to `board-verified`.

### UART/boot evidence (user-provided)

```text
u_bootloader enter
partition app @ 0x02010000
jump to:0x02010000
JMP
N4Clk tier=00000005 M1=00000420(cs=00000002 cd=00000000) A5=8407876c A9=7c7dc8a4(VDDD=00000007 VDDIG=0000000d) hz=1312d000
ABWT
NuttShell (NSH)
nsh> [ipc_svr]
create_socket failed.
nsh> K
nsh> cat /data/probe.txt
BK7258LFS-OK
```

Notes on the log:

- The real output concatenated `BK7258LFS-OK` with the next `nsh>` prompt
  because the probe file has no trailing newline; content still matched.
- `[ipc_svr] create_socket failed.` is a known non-blocking observation
  already recorded in this worklog (lines ~147-150, ~274-277) and explicitly
  classified near line 410 as a separate issue, not part of the WDT/IRQ reset
  chain. It is not a new A1 regression.
- N4Clk tier 5 with `M1=0x420` (`cs=0x02 cd=0x00`) confirms the 320 MHz
  DVFS baseline is active. `VDDD=0x00000007 VDDIG=0x0000000d` matches the
  board-verified DVFS tier-5 voltage settings.

### J-Link connection evidence (user-provided)

J-Link auto-connect selected `CORTEX-M33`, found STAR r1p0, and emitted the
known configured-core mismatch plus old J-Link firmware I/D-cache warning.
No connection-induced reboot was observed in this exact returned log; the
known tooling caveat is retained but not re-confirmed here.

Exact J-Link reads:

```text
E000ED08 = 28000800
02010100 = 32374B42 00003633
2800083C = 020108FD
2800087C = 020108FD
28000900 = 020108FD
28000904 = 020108FD
```

| A1 RAM slots 64/65 repaired to exact `0x020108FD` | `0x28000900` and `0x28000904` = `0x020108FD` | both `020108FD` | PASS |
| A1 64-external/80-logical runtime vector adaptation | all gates above | all gates above | **`board-verified`** |

### Status

`board-verified`. A1 80-slot RAM-vector relocation and repair is complete as of
2026-07-22. All required baselines (VTOR, magic, slots 15/31/64/65, UART/NSH,
WDT automonitor, LittleFS, DVFS tier 5) are board-verified.

### Boundary

- A1 is now `board-verified` as of 2026-07-22.
- This verifies A1 table relocation/repair and all required baselines; it does
  NOT implement or exercise the SDK IRQ bridge or a live SDK-owned upper-range
  peripheral IRQ.
- The SDK IRQ bridge prerequisite is now satisfied/unblocked, but bridge work
  is NOT started and requires a new explicit user instruction.
- `A/B/W/T/K` and other diagnostics remain; no cleanup.
- Flashing was user-performed; no agent flash/download/commit/push.
- Next single minimal action: stop and await explicit authorization for Stage B
  CPU0 SDK IRQ bridge; do not begin automatically.

## 2026-07-22 -- A1 board artifact identity correction before commit

### Context

The Task 3/final static review artifact (`all-app.bin` 236028 B, SHA-256
`33f68aa7261ad4e7ae163c2322fef6f64f96c7d0eeb76295816c20238ebc2293`) remains
valid historical static evidence from the v3 build and 23/23 verifier pass.
However, it was **not** the image the user flashed for the returned A1 board
test.

### User-confirmed board-flashed artifact

User confirmed they manually rebuilt at 2026-07-22 16:04 and that this rebuilt
image is the one they flashed for the A1 board evidence. Current identities:

| Artifact | Size | SHA-256 |
|----------|------|---------|
| ELF `nuttx` | 1432524 B | `ad8e8dc6bf4a0645be22dacd6b3454f0b55f769c4cf8c7ca49dad7c9b91bc45e` |
| `nuttx.bin` | 156604 B | `3f6b6e507f08700bc8a0bf8111bbd6185e49fe479cabdce62be87f932df14051` |
| `nuttx_crc.bin` | 166396 B | `a274f5497c76ada82b2a33a9e0a422808535bbac48886722860d4b19c947fa0d` |
| `all-app.bin` | 236028 B (`0x399fc`) | `a92352eeea5ebbab4eb4a7a95fd97a73d950816a3620242be8e8fc141030b5a5` |

### Precommit verifier correctly rejected stale build log

The precommit verifier correctly rejected reuse of the old v3 build log due
to a 7488-second mtime mismatch between the log and the actual artifacts on
disk. This is correct behavior: the verifier should not claim a fresh logged
build when the log does not match the current artifacts. Do not claim the old
v3 log as a fresh logged build for the board-flashed image.

### ELF layout and symbols still match

The current ELF still has:

- `_vectors` = `0x02010000`, size `0x140`
- `.ram_vectors` = `0x28000800`, size `0x140`, align 512
- `g_ram_vectors` = `0x28000800`
- `exception_common` = `0x020108fd`
- `arm_ramvec_initialize` = `0x02010869`
- `arm_ramvec_attach` = `0x02010899`

These match the user J-Link values from the board-verification session. The
board J-Link reads (VTOR, flash magic slots 64/65, RAM slots 15/31/64/65)
all matched expectations. A1 remains `board-verified`.

### Before commit

After the SDK packaging strategy is decided, perform a fresh logged
build/static verification without conflating it with the board-flashed
identity. The board-flashed artifact and the next committed build artifact
may have different hashes (NuttX embeds timestamps); record each identity
separately and do not substitute one for the other.

## 2026-07-22 -- N6 Task 13: SDK local prerequisite packaging

### Policy decision

Vendor SDK remains a local prerequisite. No file from
`board/bk7258_t5ai/bk_idk/armino_as_lib/` is committed to this repository.
The existing bundle is user-authorized local content and remains in place.

### Vendor_beken precedent comparison

The BK7236N `/home/lijian/project/armino/vendor_beken` precedent commits
proprietary blobs in a dedicated vendor-owned repo with `LICENSE-NOTES.md`.
That approach uses a separate vendor repo/manifest project with plain Git
blobs and explicit restricted license notes. It is NOT automatic
redistribution permission for this team repo. A future self-contained
distribution would require explicit Beken redistribution approval and
preferably the same dedicated-vendor-repo pattern.

### Changes made

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `.gitignore` | Added `board/bk7258_t5ai/bk_idk/armino_as_lib/` and `*.bak` rules |
| `.gitignore.example` | Same two rules added for documentation parity |
| `board/bk7258_t5ai/bk_idk/README.md` | New: explains bundle provenance, layout, linked library count, setup script usage, vendor_beken comparison |
| `board/bk7258_t5ai/scripts/setup_bk7258_sdk.sh` | New: executable Apache-2.0 shell script with `--check`, `--install`, `--help` modes |
| `board/bk7258_t5ai/scripts/bk7258_sdk_manifest.sha256` | New: SHA-256 manifest for 374 tracked files |

### Manifest counts

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Total `.a` libraries in `libs/` | 81 |
| Excluded by `BK_EXCLUDE_LIBS` in Make.defs | 50 |
| Linked (included) `.a` libraries | 31 |
| Header files in `include/` | 341 |
| Config files in `config/` | 2 |
| `.obj` files in `libs/` (not linked, not in manifest) | 4 |
| **Total manifest entries** | **374** |

### No SDK binary added/removed/modified

The setup script and manifest are verification-only tooling. No `.a`, `.h`,
`.obj`, or other SDK binary was added to, removed from, or modified in the
existing local bundle.

### Test results

#### RED/negative: missing directory

```text
$ setup_bk7258_sdk.sh --check /tmp/nonexistent_cp_dir
setup_bk7258_sdk.sh: error: directory does not exist: /tmp/nonexistent_cp_dir

exit=0
```

#### Syntax check

```text
$ bash -n setup_bk7258_sdk.sh
(exit 0, no errors)
```

### Git status evidence

After changes, `git status --short` confirms:

- `armino_as_lib/` no longer appears as untracked (ignored by rule)
- `*.bak` files (`bk7258_flash_mtd.c.bak`, `bk7258_wdt.c.bak`) no longer appear as untracked (ignored by rule)
- `bk_idk/README.md` visible as new untracked file (NOT ignored)
- `setup_bk7258_sdk.sh` visible as new untracked file
- `bk7258_sdk_manifest.sha256` visible as new untracked file
- `docs/superpowers/` remains visible as untracked (NOT ignored, explicitly excluded at staging time)

`git check-ignore -v` confirms correct rule attribution:
- `armino_as_lib/` ignored by `.gitignore:27:board/bk7258_t5ai/bk_idk/armino_as_lib/`
- `*.bak` files ignored by `.gitignore:30:*.bak`
- `README.md` NOT ignored (exit 1 from `git check-ignore`)

### Status

Packaging hygiene complete. No build, flash, commit, or push performed.

### Next single minimal action

Fresh logged precommit build/static verification, then audited commits/push.
SDK IRQ bridge not started.

## 2026-07-22 -- N6 Task 13: verifier-hardening review fixes

### Findings addressed

| # | Severity | Fix |
|---|----------|-----|
| 1 | Critical | `validate_manifest()` was fail-open: `sha256sum -c ... \|\| true` discarded the return code and only counted lines ending `: FAILED`. Missing files produce `FAILED open or read` which the old grep missed. Replaced with fail-closed: direct `sha256sum -c` exit-code check, nonzero triggers die with diagnostics. |
| 2 | Important | `--install` on a fresh clone has no `bk_idk/armino_as_lib/` parent directory. Added `mkdir -p "$(dirname "$dst_dir")"` before temp copy. |
| 3 | Minor | Report concern #3 corrected: "never removes/overwrites existing destination; removes only its own uniquely-named temp path (`.tmp.$$`)". |

### Manifest ordering

Manifest regenerated with deterministic `LC_ALL=C` sort on path column. Verified: `sort -c -k2` passes, 374 entries, 31 linked libs, 0 excluded libs.

### Test results

All 6 tests pass:

| Test | Description | Exit |
|------|-------------|------|
| 1 | RED: missing directory | 1 (PASS) |
| 2 | RED: empty directory (missing subdirs) | 1 (PASS) |
| 3 | RED: structured-empty (dirs exist, files absent) -- proves fail-closed fix | 1 (PASS) |
| 4 | GREEN: existing bundle 374/374 | 0 (PASS) |
| 5 | --install: fresh-clone-like board (parent absent) -- proves mkdir -p fix | 0 (PASS) |
| 6 | --install: refuses overwrite | 1 (PASS) |

Additional: `bash -n` exit 0, `git diff --check` exit 0, manifest ordering `sort -c -k2` OK, 31 linked/0 excluded libs verified.

### Status

Verifier-hardening complete. No build, flash, commit, or push performed. No SDK binary modified.

### Next single minimal action

Fresh logged precommit build/static verification, then audited commits/push.
SDK IRQ bridge not started.

## 2026-07-22 -- N6 Task 14: fresh precommit build/static verification

### git diff --check

```text
$ git diff --check
exit=0
```

No whitespace errors.

### Compiler warnings

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Team-file warnings (bk7258_t5ai source, excluding bk_idk) | 0 |
| SDK header warnings (bk_idk) | 50 (all redefined macros / undefined CONFIG_* from vendor sdkconfig.h) |
| Team-file errors | 0 |

### Artifact identities (precommit build, compile/static-only)

| Artifact | Size | SHA-256 |
|----------|------|---------|
| `nuttx/nuttx` (ELF) | 1432524 (0x15dbcc) | `59ba2e84d4c66d7ef32ac6ae7c8dfe1c47cdb668ae723a63bc6786989ed49986` |
| `nuttx/nuttx.bin` | 156604 (0x263bc) | `10c7733ddd0ac598b0ddf274aecde819cc445dd56f82120c937e55eef3e7ffd3` |
| `nuttx/nuttx_crc.bin` | 166396 (0x289fc) | `690728ef054c09e1633ae6a5eaf1850aa93f25c3a631436b950e7b0bcc23290d` |

Partition fit: `all-app.bin` (236028) == `bl_crc.bin` (69632) + `nuttx_crc.bin` (166396). Content concatenation verified.

**Distinction from board-flashed artifact:**
- Board-flashed (16:04): `all-app.bin` SHA-256 `a92352eeea5ebbab4eb4a7a95fd97a73d950816a3620242be8e8fc141030b5a5` (board-verified)
- Precommit rebuild: `all-app.bin` SHA-256 `d7b73c7fdf1275a90621b54e0343d6de31d343f115eb6acd0173fb971a2cf1b0` (compile/static-verified only, NOT board-tested)

Different hashes expected: source-identical but fresh build timestamp/linker layout may differ; no runtime behavioral difference expected.

### Status

Precommit build/static verification complete. All 23 gates PASS. Source-scope verified: only intended N6/A1/B2 paths modified. No ignored binaries staged. No team-file warnings. A1 source remains board-verified; new rebuild is build/static-verified only. No flash. Board code and SDK-localization tooling were committed as `66b29d1`; documentation commit and push remain.

### Next single minimal action

Commit the synchronized N6 documentation, then push `bk7258-n6-ramvectors` to `fork`.
SDK IRQ bridge not started.

## 2026-07-22 -- Stage B CPU0 SDK IRQ bridge authorized and started

### Publication baseline

The completed A1 work was published to the user fork before Stage B began:

- branch: `bk7258-n6-ramvectors`
- code/tooling commit: `66b29d1`
- documentation commit: `57558eb`
- pushed upstream: `fork/bk7258-n6-ramvectors`
- local `HEAD` and upstream both resolved to
  `57558ebaae85910aa9740976c12a2d9156c02637`

The ignored local SDK bundle, `*.bak`, and untracked `docs/superpowers/` were not
committed. No push to `origin` occurred.

### User authorization and branch

The user explicitly authorized starting the next adaptation stage on 2026-07-22
and explicitly prohibited use of Superpowers. Stage B work therefore proceeds
directly on a new local branch:

```text
bk7258-n6-sdk-irq-bridge
```

No Stage B commit or push is authorized by this instruction alone. Flashing and
download remain user-only.

### Governing Stage B scope

A1 is `board-verified`, so the CPU0 bridge gate is open. The first required
technical action is the targeted archive/link-map ownership check for
`bk_int_isr_register()` and related lifecycle APIs. Before production code:

1. identify the exact archive/object and public declarations;
2. prove whether an existing strong implementation is linked or merely present
   in an archive;
3. recover SDK source-number semantics (`0..63`) and callback signature;
4. define the one-to-one NuttX mapping (`source + 16`);
5. add RED compile/static gates before the dedicated overlay bridge module.

Production bridge code must live in a dedicated overlay module (for example
`chip/bk7258_sdk_irq.c` plus a private header), not in
`bk7258_sdk_stubs.c`. It must remain CPU0-only and preserve the A1 RAM-vector,
UART, WDT, LittleFS, and DVFS baselines.

### Current status

`static-only` research started. No Stage B source/config changes, build, flash,
commit, push, or live SDK interrupt test have occurred yet.

### Next single minimal action

Inspect the local authorized SDK archives and headers to establish exact symbol
ownership and lifecycle semantics for the CPU0 IRQ bridge. Do not build or flash
until the corresponding gate is reached and separately authorized.

## 2026-07-22 -- Stage B archive ownership and SDK IRQ semantics established

### Archive/object ownership

A read-only scan of all 81 local SDK archives found exactly one strong definition
owner for the public IRQ lifecycle API:

```text
libdriver.a:interrupt_base.c.obj: bk_int_isr_register
libdriver.a:interrupt_base.c.obj: bk_int_isr_unregister
libdriver.a:interrupt_base.c.obj: bk_int_set_priority
```

The same object also defines `interrupt_init`, `interrupt_deinit`, and
`icu_int_map_table`. No second strong definition of the three public APIs exists
in any other local SDK archive.

The current A1 ELF still links the SDK implementation:

```text
0x0202c550 T bk_int_isr_register
```

The link map proves why it is extracted:

```text
libdriver.a(timer_driver.c.obj) -> bk_int_isr_register
libdriver.a(interrupt_base.c.obj) supplies bk_int_isr_register
```

`bk_timer_driver_init()` currently calls it twice for SDK sources 3 (`TIMER`) and
13 (`TIMER1`). The SDK object then pulls `libcm33.a:arch_interrupt.c.obj`, whose
`arch_interrupt_register_int()` writes the callback into its private
`s_irq_handler[64]` and directly enables the NVIC. That private callback table is
not the NuttX `g_irqvector` dispatch table, so it is not a valid runtime bridge
when VTOR points at the A1 NuttX RAM vectors.

### Source-number mapping

The authoritative BK7258 `icu_map.h` contains 64 entries and maps every SDK
source one-to-one:

```text
SDK source 0..63 -> external NVIC line 0..63
                 -> NuttX logical IRQ 16..79
```

The linked `icu_int_map_table` bytes independently confirm each record has
`src == int_bit` from 0 through 63. Anchors remain TIMER=3, TIMER1=13,
UART1=15, ETH=48, SCALE0=49, MAILBOX=63.

### SDK lifecycle semantics recovered

The CP CM33 implementation performs:

- register: validate `src < 64`, unregister/replace the old callback, install the
  new `void (*)(void)` callback, enable the NVIC line, then apply the mapped
  default priority: 6 for sources 0..26 and 28..63, but explicit priority 0 for
  source 27 (`INT_SRC_LCD`);
- unregister: validate `src < 64`, disable the NVIC line, clear its callback;
- set-priority: apply the caller's CMSIS priority value;
- the supplied `arg` is ignored;
- callbacks run in ISR context and take no arguments.

CMSIS uses `__NVIC_PRIO_BITS=3`; SDK logical priority 6 is encoded in the
hardware byte as `6 << 5 == 0xc0`, while the LCD source's mapped priority 0 is
`0x00`. NuttX `up_prioritize_irq()` accepts an already encoded priority byte, so
the bridge must translate both mapped defaults and caller-supplied priorities
before calling it.

### Extraction/collision consequence

Defining only `bk_int_isr_register()` is not robust: any later unresolved
reference to `bk_int_isr_unregister`, `bk_int_set_priority`, `interrupt_init`, or
`interrupt_deinit` could extract the whole original archive object and create a
strong-symbol collision. The dedicated overlay bridge therefore needs to own
all five callable symbols from the CM33 path. Archive-wide undefined-symbol
inspection found no external consumer of `icu_int_map_table`, so the table need
not be reproduced; direct `src + 16` mapping is sufficient and keeps the
original object unextracted.

### Status

Task 16 scope discovery is complete at `static-only`. No production bridge code,
build, flash, commit, or push has occurred.

### Next single minimal action

Define and run a source/ELF RED verifier against the current A1 artifact. It must
fail because `bk_int_isr_register` is still supplied by
`libdriver.a(interrupt_base.c.obj)` and the dedicated overlay bridge does not yet
exist. Do not build or flash.

## 2026-07-22 -- Stage B RED verifier installed and failing as expected

### Verifier

Added the tracked overlay-only verifier:

```text
board/bk7258_t5ai/scripts/verify_bk7258_sdk_irq.py
```

It checks dedicated source/header and Make/CMake/Kconfig/defconfig integration,
exactly-one symbol ownership, archive extraction, absence of the SDK private
dispatch path, and disassembled NuttX lifecycle calls. It derives workspace paths
from its own location and dynamically reads the current ELF/link map; no symbol
addresses are hardcoded.

### Syntax check

```text
PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX=/tmp/bk7258-pycache python3 -m py_compile \
  board/bk7258_t5ai/scripts/verify_bk7258_sdk_irq.py
exit=0
```

### RED run against current A1 ELF/map

```text
python3 board/bk7258_t5ai/scripts/verify_bk7258_sdk_irq.py
RED_EXIT=1
RESULT: 3 passed, 30 failed
```

The failures are the intended missing Stage B behavior, not a script/runtime
error. Decisive RED evidence:

- dedicated `bk7258_sdk_irq.c/.h` absent;
- Kconfig/Make/CMake/defconfig gate absent;
- current `bk_int_isr_register` owner is
  `libdriver.a(interrupt_base.c.obj)`, not overlay `bk7258_sdk_irq.o`;
- unregister/set-priority/init/deinit are not retained as overlay definitions;
- the original archive object and private `arch_interrupt_*`/`icu_int_map_table`
  path remain linked;
- register/unregister disassembly does not call NuttX `irq_attach`,
  `up_enable_irq`, `up_disable_irq`, `up_prioritize_irq`, or the pending-clear
  helper.

### Status

RED is verified. No production bridge source, build, flash, commit, or push has
occurred.

### Next single minimal action

Implement the dedicated CPU0 bridge and its private pending-clear helper in the
team overlay. Do not run a firmware build until separately authorized.

## 2026-07-22 -- Stage B minimal production source implemented (unbuilt)

### Files changed

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `chip/bk7258_sdk_irq.c` | New dedicated CPU0 SDK-to-NuttX lifecycle bridge |
| `chip/bk7258_sdk_irq.h` | New private mapping constants and pending-clear declaration |
| `chip/bk7258_irq.c` | Added `bk7258_clear_pending_irq()` using the NuttX NVIC clear-pending register definition |
| `chip/Kconfig` | Added default-off `BK7258_SDK_IRQ_BRIDGE` gate |
| `chip/Make.defs` | Gate classic-Make inclusion of `bk7258_sdk_irq.c` |
| `chip/CMakeLists.txt` | Mirror the conditional source for CMake |
| `configs/nsh/defconfig` | Enable `CONFIG_BK7258_SDK_IRQ_BRIDGE=y` on this Stage B branch |

### Implemented mapping and lifecycle

- SDK source `0..63` maps directly to NuttX logical IRQ `16..79`.
- Compile-time gates require 64 sources, `INT_SRC_NONE == 64`, and final logical
  IRQ count 80.
- The initial `bk_int_isr_register()` implementation disabled and cleared the
  line, detached/replaced the old NuttX handler, applied priority 6 (`0xc0`) to
  every source, attached a NuttX wrapper, then enabled the line. Focused review
  later found this missed the SDK map's LCD source-27 priority-0 exception; see
  the 2026-07-23 F1 correction below.
- The SDK callback remains `void (*)(void)` and the supplied `arg` remains
  intentionally ignored, matching the CP CM33 implementation.
- `bk_int_isr_unregister()` disables, clears pending state, clears the callback,
  and detaches the NuttX handler.
- `bk_int_set_priority()` validates the 3-bit SDK priority and translates it to
  the raw NVIC byte expected by `up_prioritize_irq()`.
- The ISR wrapper only loads and calls the registered callback; it performs no
  allocation, logging, sleeping, or other blocking work.
- `interrupt_init()` leaves VTOR/NVIC ownership with NuttX;
  `interrupt_deinit()` unregisters only sources currently owned by this bridge.
- Owning register/unregister/set-priority/init/deinit prevents
  `libdriver.a(interrupt_base.c.obj)` from being extracted through any of its
  callable CM33 entry points.

### Boundary and status

`static-only` / unbuilt. No full compile, link, artifact verifier, flash, board
test, commit, or push has occurred. The A1 board-verified branch remains
available separately as `fork/bk7258-n6-ramvectors`.

### Next single minimal action

Run source-level checks and the verifier against the intentionally stale A1 ELF
to confirm the source gates now pass while ELF ownership remains RED. A firmware
build remains a separate authorization gate.

## 2026-07-22 -- Stage B source gates pass; stale artifact remains RED

### Checks run

```text
git diff --check
exit=0

PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX=/tmp/bk7258-pycache python3 -m py_compile \
  board/bk7258_t5ai/scripts/verify_bk7258_sdk_irq.py
exit=0

python3 board/bk7258_t5ai/scripts/verify_bk7258_sdk_irq.py
STALE_ELF_EXIT=1
```

All nine source/integration gates now pass:

```text
S01..S09: PASS
```

They prove the dedicated source/header exist, Kconfig/Make/CMake/defconfig are
synchronized, the 64-source/priority compile gates are present, and production
symbols were not placed in `bk7258_sdk_stubs.c`.

The remaining failures are expected because the verifier is deliberately reading
the old A1 ELF/map/archive produced before `bk7258_sdk_irq.o` existed. It still
observes the SDK archive owner and direct `arch_interrupt_*` path. The refined
verifier now extracts exactly `bk7258_sdk_irq.o` from `libarch.a` before checking
register/unregister disassembly, avoiding false positives from unrelated archive
members; absence of that member is fail-closed.

### Static review correction

`BK7258_SDK_IRQ_BRIDGE` now selects `ARCH_IRQPRIO`. This is required because
NuttX declares `up_prioritize_irq()` only under `CONFIG_ARCH_IRQPRIO`, while the
BK7258 chip already provides the implementation. No firmware build has yet
confirmed the selected `.config` value.

### Status

Source phase is `static-only`. RED-to-GREEN now requires a fresh firmware build
and post-link verifier run. No flash, board test, commit, or push occurred.

### Next single minimal action

Run a fresh Stage B build, then execute the verifier against its ELF/map/libarch.
Flashing remains prohibited for the agent and user-only.

## 2026-07-23 -- Stage B fresh build passes, post-link ownership remains RED

### Fresh distclean/build

```text
cd /home/lijian/project/open-vela
./build.sh vendor/openvela/boards/contest2026_135_bk7258/configs/nsh distclean
./build.sh vendor/openvela/boards/contest2026_135_bk7258/configs/nsh -j8
```

Logs:

```text
/tmp/bk7258-stageb-distclean.log
/tmp/bk7258-stageb-build.log
```

The fresh build completed through `LD: nuttx`, `CP: nuttx.bin`, CRC expansion,
`all-app.bin` concatenation, and final `savedefconfig` without a build error.
Observed artifact sizes from the postbuild log:

```text
nuttx.bin       = 156604 bytes
nuttx_crc.bin   = 166396 bytes
bl_crc.bin      = 69632 bytes
all-app.bin     = 236028 bytes
```

The generated `.config` confirms both required selections:

```text
CONFIG_BK7258_SDK_IRQ_BRIDGE=y
CONFIG_ARCH_IRQPRIO=y
```

### Fresh post-link verifier result

```text
python3 board/bk7258_t5ai/scripts/verify_bk7258_sdk_irq.py
exit=1
RESULT: 25 passed, 10 failed
log: /tmp/bk7258-stageb-verify-fresh.log
```

The dedicated bridge object is present in overlay `libarch.a`, and all register /
unregister disassembly lifecycle gates pass. However, the final link still chooses
`libdriver.a(interrupt_base.c.obj)` as owner of all five callable IRQ lifecycle
symbols. Consequently:

- `libdriver.a(interrupt_base.c.obj)` is still extracted;
- `arch_interrupt_register_int`, `arch_interrupt_unregister_int`,
  `arch_interrupt_set_priority`, and `icu_int_map_table` remain in the final ELF;
- the fresh artifact is not yet a NuttX-owned SDK IRQ bridge.

This is a link-order/archive-selection failure, not a C compile failure. Merely
placing strong replacement definitions in `libarch.a` is insufficient because the
SDK `libdriver.a` member is extracted before the overlay member satisfies the
unresolved reference.

### Status and boundary

Stage B remains `static-only` / post-link RED. The build itself succeeds, but the
ownership gate is not met. No flash, board test, commit, or push occurred. The A1
board-verified baseline remains unchanged on its published branch.

### Next single minimal action

Change team-overlay link integration so `bk7258_sdk_irq.o` is explicitly included
before the SDK archive can satisfy `bk_int_isr_register`, then rebuild and rerun the
same verifier. Do not use whole-archive for all of `libarch.a`, and do not modify
the official NuttX tree or SDK binaries.

## 2026-07-23 -- Stage B archive-selection fix implemented (unrebuilt)

### Root cause

The final ARM link places all standard NuttX archives (`LDLIBS`, including
`libarch.a`) and SDK `EXTRA_LIBS` inside one linker group. Before any SDK driver
creates an unresolved `bk_int_isr_register` reference, the first `libarch.a` scan
has no reason to extract `bk7258_sdk_irq.o`. Later in the same group,
`libdriver.a(timer_driver.c.obj)` creates the reference and the same SDK archive
immediately satisfies it with `interrupt_base.c.obj`. A subsequent group rescan
cannot replace an already resolved strong definition.

### Team-overlay fix

Added a configuration-gated linker-script root:

```ld
#ifdef CONFIG_BK7258_SDK_IRQ_BRIDGE
EXTERN(bk_int_isr_register)
#endif
```

The linker script is already preprocessed with `<nuttx/config.h>`. Therefore this
creates the unresolved bridge symbol before the archive group is scanned, causing
the earlier NuttX `libarch.a` to extract `bk7258_sdk_irq.o`. Extracting that one
member also supplies unregister, set-priority, init, and deinit, so the later SDK
`interrupt_base.c.obj` should remain unextracted. This avoids whole-archiving
`libarch.a`, direct object-path duplication, or any official-tree/SDK edit.

The Stage B verifier now has source gate `S10`, requiring the conditional linker
root and `EXTERN(bk_int_isr_register)` declaration.

### Status and boundary

Fix is `static-only` / unrebuilt. No claim of link ownership is made until a fresh
build and verifier run are GREEN. No flash, board test, commit, or push occurred.

### Next single minimal action

Run source syntax/whitespace checks, then a fresh distclean/build and the same
post-link verifier. If ownership turns GREEN, run the preserved A1 vector/magic /
partition gates before preparing the user-only timer board test.

### Pre-rebuild source and stale-artifact check

```text
git diff --check: exit 0
python3 -m py_compile verify_bk7258_sdk_irq.py: exit 0
stale-artifact verifier: exit 1, 26 passed / 10 failed
log: /tmp/bk7258-stageb-linkfix-stale-red.log
```

`S01..S10` all pass, including the new linker-extraction gate. The ten ELF/map
failures are the expected stale pre-fix artifact and still identify the SDK owner.
This preserves a clean source-pass / stale-post-link-RED transition before rebuild.

### Fresh link-fix build result

The first build invocation used the prior shell working directory and failed before
configuration with `./build.sh: No such file or directory`; no artifact was touched.
It was immediately rerun with the absolute workspace build-script path:

```text
/home/lijian/project/open-vela/build.sh \
  vendor/openvela/boards/contest2026_135_bk7258/configs/nsh distclean
/home/lijian/project/open-vela/build.sh \
  vendor/openvela/boards/contest2026_135_bk7258/configs/nsh -j8
```

Logs:

```text
/tmp/bk7258-stageb-linkfix-distclean.log
/tmp/bk7258-stageb-linkfix-build.log
```

The absolute-path rebuild completed through link, postbuild, and savedefconfig.
Observed sizes:

```text
nuttx.bin       = 156052 bytes
nuttx_crc.bin   = 165818 bytes
bl_crc.bin      = 69632 bytes
all-app.bin     = 235450 bytes
```

Compared with the pre-fix build, `nuttx.bin` decreased by 552 bytes and
`all-app.bin` by 578 bytes, consistent with removing the SDK private interrupt
object; ownership is still unclaimed until the post-link verifier runs.

## 2026-07-23 -- Stage B link ownership GREEN

### Command and result

```text
python3 board/bk7258_t5ai/scripts/verify_bk7258_sdk_irq.py
exit=0
RESULT: 36 passed, 0 failed
log: /tmp/bk7258-stageb-linkfix-green.log
```

### Decisive ownership evidence

All five callable CM33 IRQ lifecycle symbols now resolve to the overlay archive
member:

```text
nuttx/staging/libarch.a(bk7258_sdk_irq.o)
```

This includes:

```text
bk_int_isr_register
bk_int_isr_unregister
bk_int_set_priority
interrupt_init
interrupt_deinit
```

The final ELF has exactly one active `bk_int_isr_register` definition and no
lifecycle duplicates. `libdriver.a(interrupt_base.c.obj)` is not extracted.
The obsolete private CM33 dispatch symbols are absent:

```text
arch_interrupt_register_int
arch_interrupt_unregister_int
arch_interrupt_set_priority
icu_int_map_table
```

The exact extracted bridge object disassembly confirms register calls
`irq_attach`, `up_disable_irq`, `bk7258_clear_pending_irq`,
`up_prioritize_irq`, and `up_enable_irq`; unregister calls `irq_attach`
(`irq_detach` expansion), `up_disable_irq`, and the pending-clear helper.

### Status and boundary

The CPU0 SDK IRQ bridge is now `build-verified` for compile, link ownership, and
lifecycle call-path gates. It is not `board-verified`; no live SDK timer IRQ has
been exercised. No flash, board test, commit, or push occurred.

### Next single minimal action

Re-run the preserved A1 vector/magic/partition checks against this fresh artifact,
record exact hashes and warning scope, then perform a focused code/verifier review.
Only after those gates pass should a user-only non-WDT SDK timer board-test image
be prepared.

## 2026-07-23 -- Stage B preserved A1 invariants GREEN

### Result

A dynamic ELF/binary/build-log check was run against the fresh link-fix artifact:

```text
log: /tmp/bk7258-stageb-a1-invariants.log
exit=0
RESULT: 18 passed, 0 failed
```

### Preserved gates

- `.config`: `CONFIG_ARCH_RAMVECTORS=y`, `CONFIG_NCPUS=1`, no `CONFIG_SMP=y`;
  bridge and `ARCH_IRQPRIO` remain enabled.
- `_vectors`: `0x02010000`, size `0x140` (80 entries).
- `.ram_vectors` / `g_ram_vectors`: `0x28000800`, size `0x140`, 512-byte aligned.
- Flash slots 64/65: `32374b42 00003633` (`BK7236\0\0`).
- Flash slots 66..79: all `exception_common|1 = 0x020109bd`.
- Anchor slots 15/31: both `0x020109bd`.
- `up_irqinitialize()`: one call to `arm_ramvec_initialize()` and two calls to
  `arm_ramvec_attach()`.
- `nuttx.bin` fits the 1 MiB app link window.
- `all-app.bin` is byte-exact `bl_crc.bin + nuttx_crc.bin`.
- Combined-image magic remains at physical offset `0x11110`.
- Team-source warnings excluding local SDK headers: 0.
- Build-log error lines: 0.

### Fresh artifact identities (compile/static-only)

| Artifact | Size | SHA-256 |
|---|---:|---|
| ELF `nuttx` | 1417688 (`0x15a1d8`) | `44d8f973604b7d6e29c2916600dbed59d0739be24f270dc0ce22ad64beca32fd` |

These hashes identify only the fresh Stage B compile/static artifact. They are not
board-verified and do not replace the published A1 board-flashed identity.

### Status and boundary

Stage B remains `build-verified`, not `board-verified`. The A1 layout/magic /
partition baselines are statically preserved. No flash, board test, commit, or
push occurred.

### Next single minimal action

Perform focused bridge/verifier code review and a negative ownership test that
removes the linker root from a temporary linker-script copy or otherwise proves
the verifier fails closed. Then prepare, but do not flash, the minimal user-only
non-WDT SDK timer register/trigger/unregister/re-register board test.

## 2026-07-23 -- Focused review finds per-source default-priority defect

### Finding F1 (`Important`)

The authoritative BK7258 `ICU_DEV_MAP` is one-to-one for source/line numbers, but
its default priority is not uniform:

```text
sources 0..26, 28..63: IQR_PRI_DEFAULT = 6 -> raw 0xc0
source 27 (INT_SRC_LCD): explicit priority 0 -> raw 0x00
```

The current bridge instead uses `BK7258_SDK_IRQ_DEFAULT_PRIORITY` (`6`) for every
source. Registering `INT_SRC_LCD` would therefore change the SDK-defined default
from logical priority 0 to 6. This violates the required mapped-default lifecycle
semantics even though archive ownership and all current verifier gates are GREEN.

The earlier statement that all 64 sources use default priority 6 is retracted.
The existing verifier also has a coverage gap: it checks the register call path
but not the per-source mapped default or `bk_int_set_priority()` call path.

### Status

Overall Stage B returns to `blocked` pending this semantic correction and verifier
hardening. The link-order fix and A1 invariant results remain valid evidence, but
the current artifact must not be board-tested. No flash, commit, or push occurred.

### Next single minimal action

Implement a pinned `INT_SRC_LCD == 27` priority exception (0; all other sources 6),
harden the verifier for mapped defaults, generated config, and the custom-priority
call path, then rebuild and rerun all Stage B/A1 gates.

## 2026-07-23 -- F1 mapped-default correction implemented (unrebuilt)

### Production correction

- Added `BK7258_SDK_IRQ_LCD_PRIORITY = 0` while retaining the normal mapped
  default 6.
- Added compile-time `INT_SRC_LCD == 27` and priority-range assertions.
- Added `bk7258_sdk_irq_default_priority()` so register selects priority 0 only
  for `INT_SRC_LCD`; all other sources retain priority 6.
- Register still encodes the selected logical value through the common 3-bit
  shift (`0 -> 0x00`, `6 -> 0xc0`) before calling `up_prioritize_irq()`.

### Verifier hardening

Added source/config gates:

- `S11`: pinned LCD source-27 priority-zero exception;
- `S12`: Kconfig selects `ARCH_IRQPRIO`;
- `S13`: generated `.config` enables bridge and IRQ priority support;
- `S14`: exact source-to-IRQ mapping and no-argument callback semantics.

Added object-disassembly gates:

- `E07`: `bk_int_set_priority()` calls `up_prioritize_irq()`;
- `E08`: the compiled register path contains both the LCD source-27 decision and
  the normal encoded-priority-6 (`0xc0`) path, so a stale uniform-priority object
  cannot pass on source text alone.

### Status and boundary

Correction is `static-only` / unrebuilt. The previous 36/36 artifact is historical
link-ownership evidence only and remains invalid for board testing because it
contains F1. No flash, board test, commit, or push occurred.

### Next single minimal action

Run source checks and confirm the source gates pass while the hardened verifier
rejects the stale F1 object at `E08`, then fresh distclean/build and rerun all
bridge/A1 gates.

### F1 RED proof before rebuild

```text
git diff --check: exit 0
python3 -m py_compile verify_bk7258_sdk_irq.py: exit 0
verifier: exit 1
RESULT: 41 passed, 1 failed
log: /tmp/bk7258-stageb-f1-stale-red.log
```

All fourteen source/config gates pass. All prior ownership/lifecycle gates remain
GREEN. The sole failure is `E08`, because the stale object still has the old
uniform `0xc0` register path and no source-27 decision. This proves the hardened
verifier is fail-closed against the exact F1 artifact rather than accepting the
new source text with stale binary code.

## 2026-07-23 -- F1-corrected fresh build completes

### Commands and logs

```text
/home/lijian/project/open-vela/build.sh \
  vendor/openvela/boards/contest2026_135_bk7258/configs/nsh distclean

```

```text
distclean log: /tmp/bk7258-stageb-f1-distclean.log
build log:     /tmp/bk7258-stageb-f1-build.log
```

The fresh build completed through `LD: nuttx`, `CP: nuttx.bin`, CRC expansion,
combined-image packaging, and final `savedefconfig`; no build error is present in
the final output.

### Postbuild output

```text
nuttx.bin       = 156068 bytes (logical 0x261a4)
nuttx_crc.bin   = 165852 bytes (physical 0x287dc)
bl_crc.bin      = 69632 bytes (0x11000)
all-app.bin     = 235484 bytes
combined magic  = physical offset 0x11110
```

Compared with the pre-F1 link-fix artifact, `nuttx.bin` increased by 16 bytes and
`all-app.bin` by 34 bytes, consistent with adding the source-27 priority decision.
This size change alone is not semantic proof; the hardened object gate remains
authoritative.

### Evidence boundary and status

The F1-corrected source now has a successful fresh compile/link/package result.
The hardened Stage B verifier has not yet been run against this new object, and
the preserved 18-gate A1 vector/magic/partition suite has not yet been rerun.
Therefore Stage B remains `blocked` for board testing. No flash, board test,
commit, or push occurred.

### Next single minimal action

Run `verify_bk7258_sdk_irq.py` against the fresh ELF/map/archive and require all
42 gates, including object gate `E08`, to pass before any further artifact claim.

## 2026-07-23 -- Fresh F1 artifact remains RED at object gate E08

### Command and result

```text
python3 board/bk7258_t5ai/scripts/verify_bk7258_sdk_irq.py
exit=1
RESULT: 41 passed, 1 failed
log: /tmp/bk7258-stageb-f1-green.log
```

All source/config gates (`S01..S14`), archive/link ownership gates, lifecycle-call
gates, obsolete-SDK-symbol absence checks, and custom-priority gate `E07` pass.
The five public lifecycle owners remain
`libarch.a(bk7258_sdk_irq.o)`; `libdriver.a(interrupt_base.c.obj)` remains
unextracted and the four private SDK direct-dispatch symbols remain absent.

The sole failure is still:

```text
E08: register object contains LCD source-27 and normal-priority paths
```

Unlike the deliberate stale-object RED run, this result is from the freshly built
F1-corrected archive. Therefore one of two bounded explanations remains to be
proven: either the compiler emitted the mapped-default decision outside the
`bk_int_isr_register` symbol slice inspected by E08, or the production correction
was not represented as intended in the object. No conclusion is claimed until the
exact extracted object and relocations are inspected.

### Status and boundary

Stage B remains `blocked`; the fresh artifact must not be board-tested. No A1
invariant rerun, flash, board test, commit, or push occurred after this RED result.

### Next single minimal action

Extract `bk7258_sdk_irq.o` from the fresh `libarch.a` and inspect the complete
symbol/disassembly boundaries for `bk_int_isr_register`,
`bk7258_sdk_irq_default_priority`, and priority encoding. Correct production code
only if the compiled semantics are wrong; otherwise replace brittle E08 text
matching with a fail-closed object-level semantic predicate and rerun the stale and
fresh negative/positive pair.

## 2026-07-23 -- E08 root cause: correct inlined semantics, brittle immediate check

### Fresh object evidence

The exact fresh archive member was extracted from
`nuttx/staging/libarch.a(bk7258_sdk_irq.o)` and inspected with `nm -S -n` and
`objdump -dr`. The two static helpers were inlined, so they have no standalone
symbols. `bk_int_isr_register` contains the complete corrected decision:

```asm
cmp      r0, #27
ite      ne
movne.w  r8, #6
moveq.w  r8, #0
...
mov.w    r8, r8, lsl #5
...
bl       up_prioritize_irq
```

This is the intended compiled mapping:

```text
source == 27 -> logical 0 -> raw 0x00
source != 27 -> logical 6 -> shift left 5 -> raw 0xc0
```

The production correction is therefore present in the fresh object. No production
source change is required for this finding.

### Verifier defect

E08 currently requires `#27` plus a literal `#192`/`0xc0` in the register-symbol
disassembly. GCC instead retained logical constant `#6` and emitted a later
`lsl #5`; the raw value exists semantically but not as a literal immediate. E08 is
therefore a false negative caused by brittle constant-shape matching.

### Status and boundary

Production F1 semantics are object-confirmed, but Stage B remains `blocked` until
E08 is replaced with a predicate that recognizes the source-27 conditional 0/6
selection and priority-bit shift while still rejecting the historical uniform-6
object. No A1 invariant rerun, flash, board test, commit, or push occurred.

### Next single minimal action

Harden E08 around the compiled semantic sequence (`cmp #27`, conditional 6/0
selection, `lsl #5`, and the `up_prioritize_irq` relocation), then prove the new
predicate against both a stale/uniform-priority object and the fresh corrected
object before accepting 42/42 GREEN.

## 2026-07-23 -- E08 compiled-semantic predicate implemented (unverified)

The verifier now uses `has_mapped_default_priority()` instead of requiring a
literal raw `#192`/`0xc0`. The predicate requires all of the following within the
compiled `bk_int_isr_register` symbol:

- comparison against source `27`;
- conditional selection of logical priority `6` for non-LCD and `0` for LCD into
  the same register;
- left shift of that selected register by the pinned priority shift (`5` bits);
- propagation of the shifted value as argument `r1` to a register path containing
  the `up_prioritize_irq` relocation.

This is a verifier-only correction; production bridge source is unchanged. The
predicate has not yet been run against either artifact, so no GREEN claim is made.

### Next single minimal action

Run syntax/whitespace checks, then execute the verifier once with a temporary
archive whose bridge member is the exact historical uniform-priority object
(`/tmp/bk7258-sdk-irq-stale-f1.o`) and once with the current fresh archive. Require
stale E08 RED and fresh 42/42 GREEN.

## 2026-07-23 -- E08 stale/fresh pair proves RED-to-GREEN

### Pre-checks

```text
python3 -m py_compile verify_bk7258_sdk_irq.py: exit 0
git diff --check: exit 0
historical stale object exists and is non-empty: PASS
```

### Exact stale-object negative test

A temporary copy of the current `libarch.a` was created and only its
`bk7258_sdk_irq.o` member was replaced with the exact historical uniform-priority
object `/tmp/bk7258-sdk-irq-stale-f1.o`. The production archive was not modified.

```text
log: /tmp/bk7258-stageb-e08-stale-red-v2.log
exit=1
FAIL E08: register object selects LCD priority 0 and shifts normal priority 6
RESULT: 41 passed, 1 failed
```

All other gates pass. This proves the revised predicate still rejects the exact
pre-F1 compiled behavior.

### Fresh corrected-object positive test

```text
log: /tmp/bk7258-stageb-f1-green-v2.log
exit=0
PASS E08: register object selects LCD priority 0 and shifts normal priority 6
RESULT: 42 passed, 0 failed
```

The fresh artifact now passes all source/config, ownership, obsolete-symbol
absence, register/replace/unregister lifecycle, mapped-default, and custom-priority
gates. The previous E08 false negative is resolved without changing production
bridge code.

### Status and boundary

Stage B returns to `build-verified` for the F1-corrected bridge. It is not
`board-verified`; the preserved A1 invariant suite and final artifact identities
still need to be rerun/recorded before preparing any board-test image. No flash,
board test, commit, or push occurred.

### Next single minimal action

Rerun the preserved 18-gate A1 vector/RAM-vector/magic/partition/packaging/warning
suite against the F1-corrected artifact, then record fresh hashes and sizes.

These identities are compile/static evidence only. They are not board-verified and
do not replace the published A1 board-flashed artifact identity.

### Status and boundary

Stage B is `build-verified`: hardened bridge verifier 42/42 PASS and preserved A1
suite 18/18 PASS. It remains not `board-verified`; no live SDK interrupt has been
exercised. No flash, board test, commit, or push occurred.

### Next single minimal action

Perform one final focused bridge/verifier review for concrete lifecycle or
concurrency defects. If no blocker survives, prepare (but do not flash) the
minimal user-only non-WDT SDK timer register/trigger/unregister/re-register test.

## 2026-07-23 -- Focused review finds lifecycle serialization defect F2

### Finding F2 (`Important`)

The callback dispatch path is nonblocking and the target NVIC line is disabled
during each individual lifecycle operation, but the complete bridge lifecycle is
not serialized. `bk_int_isr_register()`, `bk_int_isr_unregister()`,
`bk_int_set_priority()`, and `interrupt_deinit()` access the shared callback table
and NuttX IRQ ownership through multi-step sequences without a bridge-local
critical section/spinlock.

Concrete same-source replacement race on CPU0:

1. task/ISR A attaches the wrapper for handler A and is preempted before storing A;
2. task/ISR B completes replacement with handler B and enables the line;
3. A resumes, overwrites the callback with A and enables the line;
4. final state violates completion order: the later completed replacement B is
   lost even though both calls returned success.

A similar interleaving can make a concurrent custom-priority call lose to the
register path's default-priority write. `interrupt_deinit()` also reads the table
without serialization before calling unregister.

The current extracted object confirms there is no bridge-level PRIMASK save /
interrupt-disable / restore sequence in register, unregister, set-priority, or
deinit. The nested lock inside `irq_attach()` protects only `g_irqvector[]`; it
does not protect the bridge callback table or the complete lifecycle transaction.

### Required correction

Use a bridge-local `spinlock_t` with `spin_lock_irqsave()` /
`spin_unlock_irqrestore()` around complete lifecycle transactions. In the current
CPU0 configuration (`CONFIG_NCPUS=1`, no `CONFIG_SPINLOCK`) these APIs reduce to
`up_irq_save()` / `up_irq_restore()`, which prevents interrupt-driven preemption
without adding blocking work to dispatch. Keep dispatch lock-free. Use an internal
locked unregister helper so `interrupt_deinit()` can serialize its scan without
recursive locking.

### Status and boundary

Stage B returns to `blocked` pending F2. The prior 42/42 bridge and 18/18 A1 results
remain valid for their covered semantics but do not cover lifecycle serialization.
The current artifact must not be board-tested. No flash, board test, commit, or
push occurred.

### Next single minimal action

Add fail-closed source/object verifier gates for bridge-local lifecycle
serialization and demonstrate RED against the current artifact before changing
production bridge code.

## 2026-07-23 -- F2 lifecycle-serialization RED gates installed (unrun)

Verifier additions:

- `S15` requires a bridge-local `spinlock_t`, at least four lifecycle lock/unlock
  sites, and an internal locked-unregister helper;
- `E09` disassembles register, unregister, set-priority, and deinit separately and
  requires each path to contain local IRQ save/disable/restore semantics (PRIMASK
  sequence or explicit `up_irq_save`/`up_irq_restore`).

These are verifier-only changes. Production bridge code and the current artifact
remain unchanged, so `S15` and all four `E09` instances are expected to fail.
No RED result is claimed until syntax checks and the verifier run complete.

### Next single minimal action

Run `py_compile`, `git diff --check`, and the hardened verifier against the current
F1-corrected but unlocked artifact. Require the five new gates to fail while all
prior 42 gates remain GREEN.

### F2 RED result

```text
python3 -m py_compile verify_bk7258_sdk_irq.py: exit 0
git diff --check: exit 0
verifier log: /tmp/bk7258-stageb-f2-lock-red.log
verifier exit=1
RESULT: 42 passed, 5 failed
```

The only failures are the five newly introduced F2 gates:

```text
S15: bridge-local lock serializes lifecycle transactions
E09: register path saves, disables, and restores local IRQs
E09: unregister path saves, disables, and restores local IRQs
E09: set-priority path saves, disables, and restores local IRQs
E09: deinit path saves, disables, and restores local IRQs
```

All prior F1 mapping, ownership, lifecycle-call, obsolete-SDK-symbol, custom
priority, and stale/fresh E08 gates remain GREEN. This is the intended focused RED
and proves the verifier isolates the missing lifecycle serialization.

### Status and next action

Stage B remains `blocked`. Implement the bridge-local lock and internal locked
unregister helper without adding any lock or blocking operation to dispatch, then
run source checks against the stale object before rebuilding.

## 2026-07-23 -- F2 bridge-local lifecycle serialization implemented (unbuilt)

### Production changes

- included `<nuttx/spinlock.h>` and added
  `g_bk7258_sdk_irq_lock = SP_UNLOCKED`;
- added `bk7258_sdk_irq_unregister_locked(index, irq)` for the common
  disable / clear-pending / callback-clear / barrier / NuttX detach sequence;
- `bk_int_isr_register()` now holds the bridge lock from replacement teardown
  through default priority, wrapper attach, callback publication, barriers, and
  final line enable; every error/NULL-handler path releases the lock through one
  `out` path;
- `bk_int_isr_unregister()` serializes the complete internal unregister helper;
- `bk_int_set_priority()` serializes custom priority against registration and
  unregistration;
- `interrupt_deinit()` holds the lock while scanning bridge-owned callbacks and
  uses the internal helper, avoiding recursive locking and an unlocked table read;
- `bk7258_sdk_irq_dispatch()` remains unchanged, lock-free, allocation-free, and
  nonblocking.

In the current CPU0/no-`CONFIG_SPINLOCK` configuration, the lock APIs compile to
local IRQ save/restore. The implementation does not add a sleeping primitive or
lock acquisition to ISR dispatch.

### Status and boundary

Source change is `static-only` / unbuilt. No claim is made that S15/E09 pass until
the object is rebuilt. No flash, board test, commit, or push occurred.

### Next single minimal action

Run source syntax/whitespace checks and the verifier against the intentionally
stale unlocked object. Require S15 to turn GREEN while all four E09 object gates
remain RED, proving source/object separation before the fresh rebuild.

### F2 source-pass / stale-object RED result

```text
python3 -m py_compile verify_bk7258_sdk_irq.py: exit 0
git diff --check: exit 0
log: /tmp/bk7258-stageb-f2-stale-object-red.log
exit=1
RESULT: 43 passed, 4 failed
```

Observed transition:

```text
PASS S15: bridge-local lock serializes lifecycle transactions
FAIL E09: register path saves, disables, and restores local IRQs
FAIL E09: unregister path saves, disables, and restores local IRQs
FAIL E09: set-priority path saves, disables, and restores local IRQs
FAIL E09: deinit path saves, disables, and restores local IRQs
```

This is the expected source/object split: the production source contains the lock
and helper, while the archive still contains the prior unlocked object. All prior
43 gates pass. No stale binary is accepted as F2-corrected.

### Status and next action

Stage B remains `blocked` pending a fresh distclean/build and full 47-gate verifier
run. No flash, board test, commit, or push occurred.

## 2026-07-23 -- F2 fresh distclean/build succeeds

### Commands and logs

```text

```

The build completed through link, binary copy, CRC expansion, combined-image
packaging, and `savedefconfig`.

### Postbuild output

```text
nuttx.bin       = 156108 bytes (logical 0x261cc)
nuttx_crc.bin   = 165886 bytes (physical 0x287fe)
bl_crc.bin      = 69632 bytes (0x11000)
all-app.bin     = 235518 bytes
combined magic  = physical offset 0x11110
```

Compared with the F1-only artifact, the lifecycle-lock implementation adds 40
logical bytes to `nuttx.bin` and 34 physical bytes to `all-app.bin`. Size delta is
not a correctness claim; the 47-gate verifier remains authoritative.

### Status and boundary

Fresh compile/link/package succeeded, but S15/E09 and preserved A1 gates have not
yet been run against this object. Stage B remains `blocked` for board testing. No
flash, board test, commit, or push occurred.

### Next single minimal action

Run the full Stage B verifier and require 47/47 PASS, including all four E09
lifecycle serialization paths.

## 2026-07-23 -- F2 fresh verifier RED after helper refactor

### Result

```text
log: /tmp/bk7258-stageb-f2-green.log
exit=1
RESULT: 37 passed, 10 failed
```

Source/integration/ownership gates, SDK-object exclusion, obsolete-symbol absence,
custom priority, wrapper attach, default priority call, and final enable remain
GREEN. Failures:

```text
E09 x4: register/unregister/set-priority/deinit serialization shape not recognized
E05 x2: register no longer directly calls up_disable_irq / clear-pending
E08: mapped-default compiled sequence not recognized
E06 x3: unregister no longer directly calls irq_attach / up_disable_irq /
         clear-pending
```

The E05/E06 failures are expected consequences of moving teardown into
`bk7258_sdk_irq_unregister_locked()`; the verifier still inspects only the public
symbol slices. E08/E09 may likewise reflect compiler factoring/instruction shape,
but production correctness is not assumed. The exact fresh object, internal helper,
relocations, and PRIMASK sequence must be inspected before deciding whether this is
a verifier-only adaptation or a production defect.

### Status and boundary

Stage B remains `blocked`; the fresh F2 artifact must not be board-tested. No A1
invariant rerun, flash, board test, commit, or push occurred after this RED result.

### Next single minimal action

Inspect the complete fresh `bk7258_sdk_irq.o`, including
`bk7258_sdk_irq_unregister_locked`, all four public lifecycle symbols, and their
relocations. Update verifier call-graph predicates only if the object proves the
full serialized behavior.

## 2026-07-23 -- F2 object inspection proves production semantics; verifier is stale

### Internal helper

The fresh object contains a retained local symbol:

```text
bk7258_sdk_irq_unregister_locked: size 0x34
```

Its disassembly/relocations contain the complete teardown sequence:

```text
up_disable_irq
bk7258_clear_pending_irq
callback-table store of NULL
DSB / ISB
irq_attach (irq_detach expansion)
```

Both public register and unregister contain an
`R_ARM_THM_CALL bk7258_sdk_irq_unregister_locked` relocation. Register separately
retains wrapper `irq_attach`, `up_prioritize_irq`, callback publication/barriers,
and `up_enable_irq`.

### Lifecycle serialization shape

All four lifecycle paths contain the NuttX CPU0 IRQ-save implementation:

```text
mrs ..., BASEPRI
msr BASEPRI, 0x80-equivalent register
...
msr BASEPRI, saved register
```

This is the compiled form of `spin_lock_irqsave()` / restore in the current
Cortex-M33 configuration. The verifier incorrectly recognized only PRIMASK /
`cpsid` or external `up_irq_save` symbols. Register, unregister, custom priority,
and deinit all show the BASEPRI save/mask/restore sequence.

### Mapped-default shape after F2

Register still contains:

```text
cmp source, #27
movne logical_priority, #6
moveq logical_priority, #0
mov r1, logical_priority, lsl #5
bl up_prioritize_irq
```

E08 failed only because the shift is now fused into the move to argument `r1`,
rather than performed in place and then copied.

### Conclusion

The ten failures are verifier shape/call-graph defects introduced by the legitimate
internal-helper refactor; the fresh production object implements F1 and F2 as
intended. No production correction is required from this inspection.

### Status and next action

Stage B remains `blocked` until the verifier is made helper-aware, recognizes
BASEPRI serialization and fused shift-to-argument, and proves stale/fresh
RED-to-GREEN. No flash, board test, commit, or push occurred.

## 2026-07-23 -- F2 verifier adapted to compiled call graph (unrun)

Verifier changes:

- E08 now accepts both in-place priority shifts and GCC's fused
  `mov r1, priority_reg, lsl #5` argument formation;
- E09 now recognizes PRIMASK, BASEPRI, or explicit external IRQ-save/restore
  implementations;
- E05/E06 now require teardown calls either directly in the public symbol or via
  a verified relocation to `bk7258_sdk_irq_unregister_locked` plus the callee in
  the helper body;
- new E10 requires register, unregister, and deinit all to call the locked helper,
  and requires the helper to contain detach, disable, and pending-clear calls.

The suite now contains 48 gates. These are verifier-only changes and have not yet
been run, so no GREEN claim is made.

### Next single minimal action

Run syntax/whitespace checks, then prove the exact historical unlocked F1 object
still fails F2 while the fresh F2 object passes all 48 gates.

## 2026-07-23 -- F2 historical/fresh pair proves RED-to-GREEN

### Pre-checks

```text
python3 -m py_compile verify_bk7258_sdk_irq.py: exit 0
git diff --check: exit 0
```

### Exact historical unlocked-object RED

A temporary archive copy replaced only `bk7258_sdk_irq.o` with
`/tmp/bk7258-sdk-irq-stale-f1.o`; the production archive was not modified.

```text
log: /tmp/bk7258-stageb-f2-historical-stale-red.log
exit=1
RESULT: 42 passed, 6 failed
```

Expected failures:

- four E09 lifecycle serialization paths;
- E10 locked-helper call graph;
- E08 LCD mapped-default correction.

S15 passes because source is current, while object gates reject the historical
binary. This proves the suite remains fail-closed across both F1 and F2.

### Fresh F2 object GREEN

```text
log: /tmp/bk7258-stageb-f2-green-v2.log
exit=0
RESULT: 48 passed, 0 failed
```

All source/config, archive/link ownership, obsolete-SDK-symbol absence,
helper-aware register/unregister lifecycle, mapped-default/custom-priority,
BASEPRI lifecycle serialization, and helper call-graph gates pass.

### Status and boundary

The F2 bridge is `build-verified` by the complete 48-gate suite. It is not
`board-verified`; the preserved A1 suite and final F2 artifact hashes still need to
be rerun/recorded. No flash, board test, commit, or push occurred.

### Next single minimal action

Rerun the preserved 18-gate A1 suite against the F2 artifact and record exact
hashes, sizes, warning scope, and error scope.

## 2026-07-23 -- F2 artifact preserves all A1 invariants

### Result

```text
log: /tmp/bk7258-stageb-f2-a1-invariants.log
exit=0
RESULT: 18 passed, 0 failed
```

### Preserved evidence

- generated config: RAM vectors enabled, CPU0-only (`CONFIG_NCPUS=1`, no SMP),
  bridge and `ARCH_IRQPRIO` enabled;
- `_vectors`: `0x02010000`, size `0x140`;
- `g_ram_vectors`: `0x28000800`, size `0x140`, 512-byte aligned;
- flash slots 64/65 retain `32374b42 00003633`;
- slots 66..79 and anchors 15/31 equal
  `exception_common|1 = 0x020109f9`;
- one `arm_ramvec_initialize()` and two `arm_ramvec_attach()` calls remain;
- app partition/concatenation/magic gates pass;
- team-source warnings excluding local SDK headers: 0;
- build-log error lines: 0.

### F2 artifact identities (compile/static-only)

| Artifact | Size | SHA-256 |
|---|---:|---|
| ELF `nuttx` | 1417768 (`0x15a228`) | `275f20328a21e2a01d1b991d9b9d4ea7b14c04d4235b45f1ad1653ba4cc61569` |

These are compile/static identities only and are not board-verified.

### Status and boundary

Stage B F1+F2 is `build-verified`: bridge suite 48/48 PASS and preserved A1 suite
18/18 PASS. It remains not `board-verified`; no live SDK interrupt has been
exercised. No flash, board test, commit, or push occurred.

### Next single minimal action

Complete the focused review verdict. If no further blocker survives, prepare the
minimal user-only non-WDT timer register/trigger/unregister/re-register test without
flashing it.

## 2026-07-23 -- Final focused bridge review closes with no further blocker

### Reviewed dimensions

- source `0..63` to NuttX IRQ `16..79` bounds and negative-enum rejection;
- LCD source-27 mapped default and 3-bit custom-priority encoding;
- replacement/unregister failure-safe ordering (disable, clear pending, detach,
  priority, attach, callback publication, barriers, enable);
- shared callback lifecycle serialization and helper call graph;
- NULL callback behavior and ignored SDK `arg` compatibility;
- lock-free/no-allocation/no-logging dispatch;
- NuttX `irq_attach()` internal `g_irqvector[]` lock versus bridge-local callback
  transaction lock;
- linker ownership and garbage-collection behavior;
- verifier stale-object failure behavior after F1 and F2.

### Verdict

No additional concrete blocker survives review. F1 and F2 are resolved in source
and fresh object evidence. Lifecycle APIs remain subject to the normal NuttX rule
that callers must use a context permitted to invoke IRQ-management APIs; the ISR
dispatch callback itself remains nonblocking and does not acquire the lifecycle
lock.

Stage B remains `build-verified`, not `board-verified`, until a live non-WDT SDK
interrupt source is exercised. No flash, board test, commit, or push occurred.

### Next single minimal action

Design the smallest gated non-WDT SDK timer board test that can prove callback A,
unregister silence, callback B after re-register, and baseline preservation. Build
and statically verify it, but do not flash.

## 2026-07-23 -- Timer-test channel and manual-command design fixed

### Timer channel selection

The localized CP SDK configuration disproves the earlier TIMER4/TIMER5 candidate:

```text
CONFIG_TIMER_SUPPORT_ID_BITS = 7  -> only TIMER_ID0..2 are accepted
CONFIG_TIMER_US = 1               -> TIMER_ID0 is reserved for the us timer
SDK timer API warning             -> TIMER_ID2 is used for time calibration
```

`bk_timer_start()` rejects IDs 3..5 through
`TIMER_RETURN_TIMER_ID_IS_ERR()`. A bounded source search found TIMER_ID1 users only
in the optional touch demo/driver, and none of the touch timer callbacks/entry points
are retained in the current final ELF. Therefore the test candidate is:

```text
SDK timer channel : TIMER_ID1
SDK IRQ source    : INT_SRC_TIMER (source 3)
NuttX logical IRQ : 19
status bit        : BIT(TIMER_ID1) = 0x2
```

The command will fail closed at runtime unless `bk_timer_get_enable_status()` reports
all six timer channels idle. This is stricter than checking group 0 alone because the
exported `timer_clear_isr_status()` reads and clears the six-bit status word for both
timer groups.

### Restoration and integration design

`bk_timer_driver_deinit()` is not a safe restoration primitive: it stops and resets
all six channels and does not unregister the two top-level IRQ sources. The test will
instead add a test-gated, lock-protected snapshot helper to the overlay bridge, save
the existing `INT_SRC_TIMER` callback, and restore it through the normal
`bk_int_isr_register()` path on every exit.

The test remains manual and non-booting:

- a gated chip-local runner owns SDK headers, timer status acknowledgement, callback
  counters, cleanup, and saved-handler restoration;
- the linked contest app contributes only a small NSH built-in wrapper named
  `bkirqtest`;
- the gate selects NSH built-in-app support, but no bring-up path invokes the test;
- TIMER_ID1 starts only after the all-channel-idle guard passes.

Planned live sequence:

```text
snapshot original INT_SRC_TIMER owner
register callback A -> start TIMER1 -> require callback/status bit
unregister source -> start TIMER1 -> require hardware status but unchanged counters
register callback B -> start TIMER1 -> require callback/status bit
stop/clear TIMER1 -> restore original owner
```

### Status and boundary

This is a source-backed design result only. The timer test has not yet been
implemented or built. The existing F2 artifact remains `build-verified` (bridge
48/48, A1 invariants 18/18) and not `board-verified`. No flash, board test, commit,
or push occurred.

### Next single minimal action

Implement the gated bridge snapshot helper, chip-local TIMER1 test runner, and manual
`bkirqtest` wrapper; then update this worklog before the first build.

## 2026-07-23 -- Manual TIMER1 bridge test implemented (unbuilt)

### Source/config implementation

The default-off `CONFIG_BK7258_SDK_IRQ_TIMER_TEST` gate now depends on the production
bridge plus NSH and selects NuttX built-in-app support. The BK7258 NSH defconfig
explicitly enables the gate.

New/updated implementation layers:

- `bk7258_sdk_irq.c/.h`: test-gated, bridge-lock-protected handler snapshot; it reads
  the current callback without changing NVIC/NuttX ownership, while normal dispatch
  remains lock-free;
- `bk7258_sdk_irq_timer_test.c`: chip-local SDK-aware runner, selected in both classic
  Make and CMake only under the test gate;
- `board.h`: exposes only the runner entry to the app layer;
- `app/hello_app/bk7258_sdk_irq_test_main.c`: thin manual built-in wrapper named
  `bkirqtest`; existing `hello_app` remains selectable and no bring-up path calls the
  test;
- app Make/CMake integration supports both commands without exposing private SDK
  headers to the app target.

### Fail-closed runtime sequence

The runner compile-time pins TIMER_ID1/source 3 and verifies that the pinned SDK
support mask includes TIMER1. At runtime it:

1. rejects concurrent command invocation;
2. snapshots and requires the existing `INT_SRC_TIMER` owner;
3. refuses to run unless all six SDK timer enable bits are zero;
4. stops/clears TIMER1, installs callback A, triggers the 50 ms hardware timer, and
   requires status bit `0x2` plus an A count;
5. unregisters source 3, triggers TIMER1 again, and requires status bit `0x2` while
   both callback counters remain unchanged;
6. installs callback B, triggers again, and requires B/status while A stays unchanged;
7. on every path after ownership is touched, stops/clears TIMER1 and restores the
   saved SDK owner through `bk_int_isr_register()`.

ISR callbacks only acknowledge status and update volatile counters. They do not log,
allocate, block, or call watchdog APIs. The test does not use
`bk_timer_driver_deinit()`.

### Status and boundary

Implementation is complete in source but is **unbuilt and unverified**. The only
verified firmware remains the earlier F2 compile/static artifact. No build, flash,
board test, commit, or push occurred for this timer-test change.

### Next single minimal action

Review the exact new source/config diff, run whitespace/config prechecks, then perform
the authorized fresh distclean/build and static verification. Do not flash.

## 2026-07-23 -- Timer-test source review and prechecks pass

### Review corrections and verdict

The focused source review retained the TIMER1/source-3 design and made two bounded
robustness corrections before build:

- function-pointer diagnostics now print through `uintptr_t`, avoiding an invalid
  `%p` vararg type for the saved ISR callback;
- the idle guard explicitly recognizes the SDK's unsigned
  `BK_ERR_TIMER_NOT_INIT` return before interpreting timer enable bits, and a restore
  failure is attributed to the `restore` phase.

No remaining source-level blocker was found. The runner clears peripheral status
before ownership replacement, proves the disabled phase with both a hardware status
bit and stable counters, clears peripheral/NVIC state before re-registration, and
restores the saved callback on every path after the source is touched.

### Prechecks

```text
git diff --check: exit 0
boot-call search for bk7258_sdk_irq_timer_test: no matches
forbidden-call search: no bk_timer_driver_deinit or bk_wdt call
ISR callbacks: status acknowledge + volatile counters only
```

### Status and boundary

The timer test remains unbuilt. No flash, board test, commit, or push occurred.

### Next single minimal action

Run the authorized fresh distclean/build. If it succeeds, inspect generated config,
built-in registration, final symbol/call ownership, bridge 48-gate results, and the
preserved A1 invariant suite. Do not flash.

## 2026-07-23 -- Fresh timer-test distclean/build succeeds

### Build result

```text
distclean log: /tmp/bk7258-stageb-timer-test-distclean.log
build log:     /tmp/bk7258-stageb-timer-test-build.log
distclean + build combined exit: 0
```

The normal configuration step removed the now-redundant explicit `CONFIG_BUILTIN=y`
line from the saved defconfig because `BK7258_SDK_IRQ_TIMER_TEST` selects BUILTIN;
the test gate itself remains explicitly enabled. Generated-config confirmation and
all post-link/static gates are still pending and no correctness claim is made from
build exit alone.

### Status and boundary

The timer-test artifact is freshly built but not yet statically accepted and not
board-verified. No flash, board test, commit, or push occurred.

### Next single minimal action

Verify generated config, NSH built-in registration, exact runner/snapshot call graph,
absence of forbidden test calls, bridge ownership/invariants, A1 preservation,
warnings/errors, and artifact identities. Do not flash.

## 2026-07-23 -- First post-build timer-test gate is RED: command absent

### Passing evidence

```text
CONFIG_BK7258_SDK_IRQ_TIMER_TEST=y
CONFIG_BK7258_SDK_IRQ_BRIDGE=y
CONFIG_BUILTIN=y
CONFIG_NSH_BUILTIN_APPS=y
CONFIG_ARCH_IRQPRIO=y
CONFIG_ARCH_RAMVECTORS=y
CONFIG_NCPUS=1
bridge verifier: RESULT 48 passed, 0 failed
build-log error lines: 0
```

### Blocking evidence

The final ELF contains the SDK `timer_clear_isr_status` symbol but none of the new
manual-test entry points:

```text
bkirqtest_main                         absent
bk7258_sdk_irq_timer_test             absent
bk7258_sdk_irq_test_snapshot_handler  absent
bk7258_irqtest_callback_a/b           absent
```

No `bkirqtest` registration was found under generated apps output or `nuttx.map`.
Therefore config selection alone did not place the app/runner in the final link. The
new artifact is post-build **RED** and must not be board-tested. Raw build-log warning
count is 103 and still requires scope analysis; it is not yet a team-warning result.

### Status and boundary

Stage B production bridge remains 48/48 build-verified, but the timer-test addition is
`blocked` on missing build/link integration. No flash, board test, commit, or push
occurred.

### Next single minimal action

Inspect whether the chip test object entered `libarch.a`, whether the linked app
package's Make.defs/Makefile were traversed, and how generated built-in registration
selects package apps. Fix only the proven missing integration, then rebuild.

## 2026-07-23 -- Missing-command root cause isolated to package category traversal

### Exact split

The chip side is correct: `libarch.a` contains `bk7258_sdk_irq_timer_test.o`, and the
archive exports the runner, both callbacks, and the bridge snapshot helper. They are
removed from the final ELF only because no app references the runner.

The app side is never traversed. Root `packages/Make.defs` includes only:

```make
include $(wildcard $(APPDIR)/packages/*/Make.defs)
```

The manifest links the team app at
`packages/demos/contest2026_135_hello_app`, but `packages/demos/Make.defs` does not
exist. Therefore the root wildcard never reaches the app's own `Make.defs`; no app
object or built-in registration is generated.

### Fix boundary

Do not edit the official `packages/` checkout. Add team-owned `packages/demos`
category aggregators through new manifest `linkfile` entries, so classic Make reaches
child `Make.defs` and the CMake/Kconfig backends have equivalent category traversal.
Then apply the manifest links locally and rebuild.

### Status and next action

Timer test remains post-build RED and not board-testable. No flash, commit, or push
occurred. Next: add the team-owned category aggregators + manifest links, refresh
linkfiles locally, and rebuild once.

## 2026-07-23 -- Team-owned package category aggregators added (unverified)

Added `app/demos/Make.defs`, `CMakeLists.txt`, and `Kconfig`, plus manifest linkfiles
targeting `packages/demos/`. Classic Make now has an intended category include for
child demo `Make.defs`; CMake and Kconfig have matching traversal. No official
`packages/` file was edited directly.

The links have not yet been refreshed into the generated workspace and no rebuild has
run. Next: apply linkfiles locally, confirm all three generated symlinks, then rebuild.

### Local link refresh blocker

`repo sync -l contest2026_135_yongwangzhiqian` failed before link creation because
repo rejects this project's current `.git` checkout state as unsupported. The
manifest remains the authoritative persistent fix. For this existing workspace only,
create the three exact manifest-owned symlinks manually (without editing tracked
`packages/` content), verify their targets, and continue the rebuild.

All three symlinks were created and resolve to the team-owned aggregator files. Next:
one fresh distclean/build and post-link verification.

## 2026-07-23 -- TIMER1 IRQ bridge test is build/static GREEN; user fast-download board test authorized

### Fresh artifact and timer-test integration

The package-category links are active. After enabling `CONFIG_SYSTEM_TIME64=y` for the independent 4295-second system-time fix and replacing the timer-test include with `<nuttx/spinlock.h>`, the full BK7258 target links successfully. The include correction only resolves the test's `enter_critical_section()` / `leave_critical_section()` declarations; it does not change production bridge behavior.

Final post-link evidence:

```text
CONFIG_BK7258_SDK_IRQ_BRIDGE=y
CONFIG_BK7258_SDK_IRQ_TIMER_TEST=y
CONFIG_SYSTEM_TIME64=y
bkirqtest_main                         present @ 0x0202a3c4
bk7258_sdk_irq_timer_test             present @ 0x0202aa34
bk7258_sdk_irq_test_snapshot_handler  present @ 0x02010608
bk7258_irqtest_callback_a/b           present
builtin_list -> bkirqtest_main        present in nuttx.map
bridge verifier                       48 PASS / 0 FAIL
```

Current immutable handoff artifact until the next rebuild:

```text
path:    /home/lijian/project/open-vela/nuttx/all-app.bin
size:    240618 bytes (0x3abea)
sha256:  21a4f281cccf87500bd7c67a31d6aa097cfe0bb175ab9730d5a0bf5f44f589e9
build:   exit 0
log:     /tmp/bk7258-4295s-build-after-irq-fix.log
verify:  /tmp/bk7258-stageb-current-verify.log
```

The previous post-build RED condition (missing app traversal / absent command) is resolved. Stage B production bridge plus the manual TIMER1 test is now **build-verified/static GREEN**, but not yet board-verified.

### Authorized quick-download validation

The user will perform Windows BKFIL/bk_loader downloads; no agent-side download is required. Use full-image fast download at physical offset `0x0`, then run the manual command from NSH. Repeat at least three independent download/boot cycles to exercise cold initialization and handler restoration repeatedly.

Per cycle:

1. fast-download this exact `all-app.bin` and boot to NSH;
2. confirm baseline NSH/UART/WDT/LittleFS remains alive;
3. run `bkirqtest` three consecutive times;
4. require every invocation to print callback A, silent-unregistered phase, callback B, `restore OK`, and final `PASS`;
5. reject any `FAIL`, spontaneous `HF`/reset, lost NSH input, or failure to restore the original TIMER owner.

Repeated downloads restart uptime. The independent 4295-second fix therefore receives its final `>4400 s` validation only after the last IRQ download/test cycle, using the final retained firmware.

### Next single minimal action

User performs the repeated Windows fast-download cycles and returns complete UART output for each `bkirqtest` run. Do not continue to another IRQ source until this TIMER1/source-3 bridge test is board-verified.
