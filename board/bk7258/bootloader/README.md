This is the Tier-1 rewrite of the hand-written minimal BK7258 bootloader. It
keeps the **verified** cold-boot invariants and jump target (app @ logical
`0x02010000`), while making debug and console ownership explicit. The binary
has three clean layers and three Tier-1 features:

| Feature | What | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **I** Configurable boot logging | UART0/1/2 or silent diagnostics | `start.S`, `boot_main.c` |
| **A** FAL partition table parse | locate `cp_app`, derive logical addr | `boot_main.c` |
| **J** Hardened jump epilogue | VTOR / dsb / isb / MSP / clear r0-r12 / bx | `start.S` |

## MCUboot BL2 chain (MCUBOOT product mode)

Raw bring-up and MCUboot product modes intentionally use different BL1
handoffs. A raw product packages a NuttX vector image, so BL1 resolves
`cp_app`, validates its MSP/reset/magic and returns `0x02010000` directly to
`start.S`. Before that direct branch, BL1 widens the public boot-stage
`MSPLIM=0x2802f800` to the NuttX CP RAM lower bound `0x28010000`; otherwise
the CP reset wrapper's first stack push is below the inherited limit. Only a
MCUboot product composition sets `BL1_USE_BL2=1`; that composition
packages a signed MCUboot image and changes the handoff to SRAM BL2. Sending a
raw vector image through BL2 is invalid and causes BL2's failure watchdog
reset.

The current `t5_board_bringup` product changes the handoff to:

```text
BL1 -> primary Manifest + BL2 @ 0x024d0000
                  \\ on failure
                   -> secondary Manifest + BL2 @ 0x024f0000
                      -> fixed Primary/Secondary order in SRAM
                      -> NuttX MCUboot validates one CP/AP pair at a time
                      -> CP/AP
```

Both BL2 copies reserve 128 KiB logical (136 KiB after the official 32+2
CRC expansion). The primary uses the CSV `bl2` row at raw `0x51d000`; the
secondary uses the immediately following board-reserved span at raw
`0x53f000`, ending before LittleFS. The two 256-byte board-owned Manifest
records are stored in the boot logical tail at `0x0200ff00` (primary) and
`0x0200fe00` (secondary). These records are a recoverable development
authorization layer, not a claim about the unpublished BK7258 BootROM ABI.

BL1 does not accept or launch an application image. It verifies the two BL2
candidates in fixed Primary-then-Secondary order and publishes that order
through the checked SRAM record at `0x2801ffd0`. BL2 consumes the record once
and runs the pinned upstream MCUboot `boot_go()` against each permitted
physical CP/AP pair in order. No retired OTA journal or Flash writer is linked
into this chain.

Debug and console ownership are passed in from the selected canonical CP role
view. For
direct boot, BL1 reasserts the configured SWD route after final cache/MPU
cleanup and can wait for `DHCSR.C_DEBUGEN` immediately before the CP branch.
That bit only admits the probe to the hold loop; it does not release the boot
stage because it appears before CoreSight enumeration finishes. After attach,
write `0x4a4c4e4b` (`JLNK`) to `0x2809f7f0` and resume the core to release the
held boot stage. The intentional hold disables the boot watchdogs while the
core may be halted. It leaves them disabled across the short application
branch because re-enabling after an unbounded hold can immediately consume a
stale watchdog count; the CP reset entry then takes watchdog ownership.
For MCUboot, BL1 does not hold before SRAM BL2; BL2 applies the same route and
optional hold after authentication and its final handoff cleanup. The current
T5-Board bring-up product uses P0/P1, targets CP and keeps the boot UART silent.
P20/P21 and UART0/UART1/UART2 remain selectable for non-conflicting profiles.

The package emits `bl2_crc.bin` and `bl2_secondary_crc.bin`, and the WSL2
download SOP writes both ranges. Existing `--manifest` invocations remain an
alias for the primary record. No NuttX or SDK source is modified and no
OTP/eFuse write is part of this path.

### Official-shaped XIP control-page artifact (opt-in)

The public BK7236/Armino XIP packer creates a separate 4 KiB
`bl1_control.bin`: it fills the page with `0xff` and copies the first 64
bytes of `bl2.bin` (the vector hand-off) to offset zero. The repository-owned
adapter reproduces that packaging rule without changing the active layout:

```bash
make bl1-control                 # reads bl2/bl2.bin
# or: make bl1-control BL2_IMAGE=/path/to/bl2.bin \
#                    BL1_CONTROL_IMAGE=/tmp/bl1_control.bin
```

This target is not part of the default `make` and must not be flashed as a
claim that BK7258 BootROM accepts the undocumented secure-boot ABI. It is a
reversible artifact for the ongoing BL1/BL2 reverse-engineering work; the
generator performs no signing, device I/O, OTP, or eFuse operation.

The same page-size rule is available for the candidate Manifest generator:

```bash
python3 bk7258_bl1_pack.py manifest --format beken-candidate-v1 \
  --container-size 0x1000 --bl2 /path/to/bl2.bin \
  --private-key /tmp/bk7258-bl1-manifest-dev-key.pem --out primary_manifest.bin
```

Use the same command with the secondary BL2 XIP address and output name for
`secondary_manifest.bin`. Without `--container-size`, the existing 256-byte
boot-tail record is unchanged.

The generator checks that the private key derives to the board-owned
development root compiled into `boot_bl1_manifest_key.c`. A random EC256 key
is intentionally rejected at packaging time; otherwise BL1 would reject the
resulting page with the root-anchor error (`rc=0x4`). This root is only a
reversible software test root and is not the unpublished BK7258 BootROM/OTP
root.

## Logical / physical layout

```
FLASH logical base 0x02000000, logical slot 0x10000 (64 KiB)
  0x000..0x0FF  vector table  (64 entries: MSP=0x2809F700, Reset, NMI, HardFault, 60x default)
  0x100..0x107  bl magic      "BK7236\x10\x00"  (bytes: 42 4B 37 32 33 36 10 00)
  0x108..0x1FF  vector table  (62 entries -> Reset_Handler)
  0x200..       Reset_Handler : verified init + selected I/O -> bl c_main -> hardened epilogue
  .rodata      FAL executable partition table (4 entries x 64 B; see bl.map)

Physical image (bl_crc.bin): 32 B data + 2 B CRC16 per block -> 0x11000 bytes.
Physical slot: 0x0 .. 0x11000 on flash.
```

### FAL partition table (.rodata, `struct fal_partition`, 64 B/entry)

| name | flash_name | offset | len | logical addr |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| bootloader | beken_onchip_crc | 0x000000 | 0x010000 | 0x02000000 |
| cp_app | beken_onchip_crc | 0x010000 | 0x140000 | 0x02010000 |
| ap_app | beken_onchip_crc | 0x150000 | 0x110000 | 0x02150000 |
| bl2 | beken_onchip_crc | 0x4d0000 | 0x020000 | 0x024d0000 |

magic_word `0x45503130` (`'E','P','1','0'`), matches the BK SDK
`fal_partition.c` / `fal_def.h`. Normal `c_main` resolves `cp_app`; an
MCUboot-profile `c_main` resolves `bl2`. CP/AP remain contiguous so MCUboot can
validate and hand off one paired slot.

## Build & pack

Requirements: `arm-none-eabi-gcc` (10.3 verified) and `python3`.

```bash
cd board/bk7258/bootloader
make            # produces bl.elf, bl.bin (logical), bl_crc.bin (physical)
make verify     # boot symbols and FAL/table inspection
make clean
```

`make verify` reports the current `bl.elf` size/map; do not reuse historical
text-size numbers after changing the clock/WDT/FAL implementation. Stable
packer invariants are:

```
packer:
  logical_size: 0x10000      physical_size: 0x11000
  sp: 0x2809f700             reset: 0x2000201   (Reset_Handler | 1, Thumb)
  magic: 424b373233361000    magic_physical_offset: 0x110
```

`bss` is 0 on purpose: `c_main` uses only `const` (`.rodata`) and stack
locals, so no C-runtime `.bss` zeroing is needed and `start.S` can call
`c_main` directly.

## Board flashing (bootloader @ physical 0x0)

Flash **only** the new bootloader, leaving the existing app probe untouched at
logical `0x02010000`:

```bash
# bl-only flash into the physical bootloader slot [0x0, 0x11000)
<tool> --mainBin-multi board/bk7258/bootloader/bl_crc.bin@0x0-0x11000

# normal CP + AP split update; take exact lengths from
# nuttx/bk7258-dual/bk7258-dual-image.json
<tool> --mainBin-multi \
    'board/bk7258/bootloader/bl_crc.bin@0x0-0x11000,<app_crc.bin>@0x11000-<cp_crc_length>,<app1_crc.bin>@0x165000-<ap_crc_length>'
```

`bk_loader.exe` requires the complete multi-image list as one comma-separated
argument. Passing each segment as a separate shell argument is invalid and
can make later lengths apply to the first segment.

The bootloader physical region is exactly `0x11000` bytes
(`(0x10000 / 32) * 34`); flashing outside `[0x0, 0x11000)` is wrong for the bl
image. The CP segment occupies at most raw `0x11000..0x165000`; AP occupies at
most `0x165000..0x286000`. LittleFS is raw
`0x600000..0x700000`. Normal updates remain sparse/multi-segment;
the explicit ADR-004 migration uses `all-app-factory.bin` only for raw
`0x000000..0x4fb000` plus `littlefs_factory_clear.bin` at
`0x600000..0x700000`.  The gap contains vendor `usr_config` and reserved
bytes and is deliberately absent from both files.  Neither segment may touch
the calibration tail at `0x7fa000`.
Do **not** run the commands in this repo — build/inspect only; flash on the
board with your usual BK tooling.

## Expected boot-UART log

With the existing app probe (which carries its own `BK7236\x10\x00` magic at
its `0x100`) flashed at logical `0x02010000`:

```
u_bootloader enter
partition app @ 0x02010000
jump to:0x02010000
JMP
BK7258 PROBE...            <- produced by the app probe after the handoff
```

If header validation fails, the bootloader prints `BAD` + a short reason
(`msp OOR` / `reset no-thumb` / `magic0` / `magic1` / `no app part`) and
hangs. Output uses the boot UART, baud and frame selected from the CP profile.
RTT/NONE profiles deliberately produce no boot-UART bytes.

## Rollback

If the new bootloader does not start, re-flash the previously verified minimal
bootloader image (no C layer):

```bash
<tool> --mainBin-multi \
    /home/lijian/project/TuyaOpen/zephyr-bk7258-port/out/custom_bootloader/bk7236_min_bl_crc.bin@0x0-0x11000
```

## Design notes / deviations from the spec

- **Cold-init invariants are preserved.** Interrupt masking, watchdog, Flash
  and clock preparation retain the verified sequence. SWD group/core and the
  optional UART pinmux/clock/frame are compile-time inputs derived from the CP
  defconfig, so BL1 does not reclaim pins owned by another transport.
- **Jump target unchanged.** Still app @ logical `0x02010000`.
- **Cache/MPU cleanup is explicit.** `boot_runtime.c` clean-room reconstructs
  the Armv8-M SCB/MPU sequence from the official v3.1.1.9 normal bootloader:
  reset invalidates stale cache state, and handoff cleans/disables D-cache,
  disables/clears MPU regions, and invalidates I-cache before changing the
  application execution context.
- **UART TX poll is bounded.** Bit 20 of the selected UART status register is
  polled as "TX-FIFO-not-full", but the busy-wait is bounded so a damaged or
  unavailable console cannot hang verified-image boot.
- **Hardened epilogue** preserves `r2` (app `Reset_Handler`) while clearing
  `r0,r1,r3..r12`, then `bx r2` — mirrors BK §2.7's clear-and-branch.
