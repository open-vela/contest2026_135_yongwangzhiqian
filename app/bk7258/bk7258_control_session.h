/* SDC1 plaintext inside pinned TLS only. Header: magic, opcode, sequence,
 * payload length, all BE32. AUTH=1/32 bytes, STATUS=2/empty, CANCEL=3/empty,
 * VOLUME=4/BE32 0..100, PERSONA=5/BE32 0..4, CLEAR_HISTORY=6/empty. AUTH starts at sequence zero;
 * subsequent requests increase by one. One request/response at a time.
 * Response opcode has bit31 set, payload is signed error plus five BE32
 * fields: flags, volume, persona, turn state, last runtime error. Unknown
 * fields are UINT32_MAX. Flags: ready=1,busy=2,turn-known=4,volume-known=8,
 * persona-known=16, memory-known=32, memory-enabled=64, memory-pending=128,
 * memory-failed=256, memory-supported=512. MEMORY_SET=7/BE32 0..1,
 * MEMORY_DELETE=8/empty, INFO=9/empty. INFO response replaces the normal
 * status fields with major, minor, revision, build and security counter. OTA
 * responses replace them with state, phase, progress, total and result.
 * Unknown response fields are UINT32_MAX (and -1 for signed result);
 * BEGIN/APPEND do not invent runtime progress.
 * pending must clear and failed remain false before success is displayed.
 * wifi-known=1024, wifi-ready=2048: coherent link plus usable AP lease only,
 * never proof of Internet/provider reachability. Older firmware omits both. A successful CANCEL acknowledges the request, not drain.
 * No API key, Wi-Fi credential, factory secret or owner key is returned.
