/* SDC1 plaintext inside pinned TLS only. Header: magic, opcode, sequence,

 * VOLUME=4/BE32 0..100, PERSONA=5/BE32 0..4, CLEAR_HISTORY=6/empty. AUTH starts at sequence zero;
 * subsequent requests increase by one. One request/response at a time.
 * Response opcode has bit31 set, payload is signed error plus five BE32
 * fields: flags, volume, persona, turn state, last runtime error. Unknown
 * fields are UINT32_MAX. Flags: ready=1, busy=2, turn-known=4, volume-known=8,
 * persona-known=16, memory-known=32, memory-enabled=64, memory-pending=128,
 * memory-failed=256, memory-supported=512. MEMORY_SET=7/BE32 0..1,
 * MEMORY_DELETE=8/empty, INFO=9/empty. INFO response replaces the normal
 * status fields with major, minor, revision, build and security counter. OTA
 * responses replace them with state, phase, progress, total and result.
 * Unknown response fields are UINT32_MAX (and -1 for signed result);
 * BEGIN/APPEND do not invent runtime progress.
 * pending must clear and failed remain false before success is displayed.
 * wifi-known=1024, wifi-ready=2048: coherent link plus usable AP lease only,
 * never proof of Internet/provider reachability. Older firmware omits both. A successful CANCEL acknowledges the request, not drain.
 * No API key, Wi-Fi credential, factory secret or owner key is returned.

 * product's devices. Bit 16384 advertises
 * support. Kind 1 is MCP1 ASR/chat/TTS names only, never credentials.
 * Kind 9 is the factory-reset transaction. BEGIN/APPEND/APPLY carry SRT1:
 * magic, reserved BE32 zero, expected revision BE64, and a nonzero 16-byte
 * transaction. APPLY returns zero only after SRV1 is durable; -EAGAIN means
 * the client must retry that exact SRT1 transaction. READ normally carries
 * four bytes, but RESET_TRANSFER READ carries those four bytes followed by
 * the 16-byte transaction and returns SRS1 (state/reserved/transaction).
 * It is authenticated and read-only: PENDING is not completion and no query
 * can request or resume an erase.
 * The staging buffer is shared with OTA, so transfers cannot interleave.
 * APPLY acknowledges a worker request; READ must confirm its actual result.
