 * sequences are independent arbiter-local counters: each starts at one and
 * advances by exactly one.  A transport that filters unrelated wire frames
 * must assign these counters after its own wire-sequence validation.  Any
 * event with a matching token and the exact next sequence consumes that
 * sequence even when the current state rejects the event.  Replays, gaps and
 * foreign tokens do not consume a sequence.  Any -EOVERFLOW result closes
 * the session and is terminal for it.
