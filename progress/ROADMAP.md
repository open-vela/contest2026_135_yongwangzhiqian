# Roadmap

Last reviewed: 2026-08-08

## Latest completed baseline: N16 Wi-Fi STA data plane

- CP owns official v3.1.1.9 RF/PHY/MAC/WPA/controller and DHCP. AP logical CPU0
  owns the official proxy plus a repository adapter into native NuttX `wlan0`
  and sockets; vendor AP lwIP/socket and SDK FreeRTOS remain excluded.
- Runtime STA, wrong-password recovery, local TCP/UDP, retained-service
  coexistence, AP-restart refusal and 3/3 RTS recovery are board-verified.
- Official SDK/NuttX/apps source remains unmodified. Read the N16 worklog and
  phase verification before changing the accepted lifecycle boundaries.

## Prior completed baseline: N15

- The official-style contiguous CP/AP A/B layout and ADR-006 symmetric
  dual-bank selector are merged and board-verified for the approved scope.
- Generation 314 completed A-to-confirmed-B through bank 0; generation 315
  completed B-to-confirmed-A through bank 1. Both inactive pairs passed full
  Flash read-back/SHA and retained N14 services.
- Confirmed A survived RTS and complete removal of USB and J-Link power. The
  board was restored with a bounded normal gates-zero sparse image; AP SMP,
  RPTUN, LittleFS and PSRAM passed and `bkota` is absent.
- Physical rollback and analog mid-program brownout were not part of the
  approved minimal N15 board run. Future Flash writes require fresh authority.

## Active MAIN stage: N17-SB Secure Boot reverse/port

The official BK7258 v3.1.1.9 SDK has no buildable Secure Boot adaptation.
Technical support confirmed that BK7236 and BK7258 share the security
architecture, while BK7236 is single-core. Therefore BK7236 `bk_idk`
documentation/source is the semantic reference; BK7258 addresses, Manifest
bytes, OTP/eFuse ABI and CP/AP mapping must still be source- or board-verified.

The active objective is a complete recoverable board-owned BL1 -> NuttX
MCUboot BL2 -> CP/AP SMP chain. No NuttX/SDK source changes, OTP/eFuse writes,
secure-boot enable, lifecycle transition or debug lock are allowed.

The current raw-page candidate proof (`B1PAGE -> BL2RAM -> MCUboot -> NSH`)
is an implementation checkpoint, not proof of BK7258 BootROM acceptance.

## N17-SB phases and gates

1. **SB0 — scope/evidence freeze**: separate BK7236 reusable semantics from
   unproven BK7258 facts; freeze the recoverable development boundary.
2. **SB1 — BK7236 reference extraction**: record the reference BL1 sequence,
   MCUboot 1.9 behavior, Manifest semantics, partition/security tables and
   AES/CRC/padding/merge/signing order.
3. **SB2 — BK7258 read-only boundary**: confirm raw Flash reads, CRC-XIP
   conversion, Manifest sectors, TrustEngine/OTP shadow state and CP/AP
   placement using source review and minimal J-Link/UART evidence.
4. **SB3 — BL1**: finish Manifest A/B parsing, root-hash policy, version floor,
   BL2 digest/signature verification, fallback and SRAM handoff.
5. **SB4 — BL2**: finish the pinned NuttX MCUboot integration, CP/AP same-slot
   validation, image/TLV signature checks, security-counter policy and vector
   handoff.
6. **SB5 — packaging**: implement the BK7258-specific CRC and optional AES
   stages and represent the documented padding/merge/signing order without
   forcing BK7236 single-core layout onto the CP/AP pair.
7. **SB6 — A/B recovery**: verify normal boot, invalid Manifest/BL2, slot
   fallback, mismatched CP/AP pair and software rollback floor with only the
   existing download/UART/J-Link tools. Do not create a campaign framework
   before a recurring test need exists.
8. **SB-H — hardware root (deferred)**: only after new authority and real
   BK7258 material are available, bind the implementation to OTP/eFuse and
   BootROM Secure Boot. This is not part of the current board work.

### Gate status at 2026-08-08

- **SB0-SB2: complete for the reversible evidence boundary.**  BK7236
  semantics, BK7258 read-only TrustEngine/OTP shadow state, the 128 KiB BL2
  capacity and the two-stage source crosswalk are recorded.  BK7236 addresses
  and undocumented ABI values remain explicitly excluded.
- **SB3-SB4: implementation and board regression complete.**  The board-owned
  BL1 candidate page, primary/secondary BL2 fallback, pinned NuttX MCUboot
  validation, CP/AP same-slot/version/counter gate and vector handoff all pass
  the normal and negative captures.  This is not proof of the BootROM ABI.
- **SB5: host-reference complete, hardware exactness open.**  The v3.1.1.9
  source order (logical merge -> MCUboot sign/pad -> optional AES -> 32+2
  CRC -> physical tail/status placement) is emitted as a separately labelled
  artifact.  The exact BK7258 AES key/consumer and BootROM CRC read view are
  not available, so that artifact is not flashed.
- **SB6: recoverable development matrix complete.**  Manifest/key rejection,
  BL2 fallback, A/B selection, cross-slot/version/vector rejection and the
  compile-time security-counter floor are covered.  Persistent OTP/NV
  rollback is intentionally not claimed.
- **SB-H: blocked by missing BK7258 BootROM Manifest/OTP ABI and by the
  explicit no-irreversible-write rule.**

Network OTA transport (old N18 proposal) is paused until SB6 exits.

## Later candidates

- Bluetooth/Wi-Fi warm restart with pointer quiesce and mailbox teardown.
- General upper-8 MiB PSRAM allocator ownership and cache/DMA policy.
- Product hardening: uncontrolled power cuts, voltage/temperature stress,
  long-duration networking and Flash wear characterization.
- Legacy SDK validation only after the v3.1.1.9 product path is fully complete
  and the owner requests it explicitly.

## Explicitly deferred

- Linking the vendor AP lwIP/socket stack into NuttX.
- CP-hosted remote sockets or a new RPMsg Ethernet protocol.
- SoftAP, bridge/repeater, monitor mode, raw injection and Wi-Fi power-save in
  the first N16 release.
- Repeating the N15 migration, chip erase, future OTA mutation or destructive
  board workflow without explicit owner authority.
- ADR-003 sector-swap, CPU0 direct 480 MHz, QEMU and unrelated debug-SOP work.
