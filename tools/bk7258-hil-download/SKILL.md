description: Profile, preflight, run, and verify BK7258 direct/full or bounded multi-segment downloads with Beken BK Loader, then hand off reset-synchronized UART/J-Link evidence collection to windows-hardware-debug. Use for AIDK AI Toy, T5-Board, T5AI-Core, or a newly reviewed BK7258 board profile when an exact artifact, physical target, and COM route must be handled reproducibly. Do not use for unknown boards, OTP/eFuse/security writes, unverified package trust, or as a substitute for signed OTA deployment.

# BK7258 Profiled HIL Download

Use this skill as the BK7258 Flash transport layer. Keep generic Windows UART,
reset, J-Link, and BLE work in the sibling `windows-hardware-debug` skill. The
two skills compose; neither silently broadens the other's safety boundary.

## Workflow

1. Read the applicable repository instructions and artifact manifest. Separate
   direct/full recovery, signed bounded segments, and signed OTA before opening
   a COM port.
2. Run `scripts/bk7258_hil_download.py profiles --board <board>` and verify the
   board identity, COM roles, transport, reset policy, and source references.
   Board and port are mandatory inputs; there is no default COM or default
   physical target.
3. For Beken BK Loader transport, read
   [references/SOP.zh-CN.md](references/SOP.zh-CN.md), then run `preflight`.
   Use `single` for one bounded/full BIN and `multi` for reviewed
   `PATH@OFFSET-LENGTH` segments. Every segment length must equal its file size,
   ranges must not overlap, and hashes are recorded.
4. Treat `artifact_kind_claim` as an operator label, not signature proof. For a
   signed package, first use the repository's package/trust verifier and only
   then pass the verified extracted BIN or manifest-declared segments. Signed
   OTA stays on `tools/bk7258/bk7258.py deploy`.
5. Execute `run --execute --evidence-dir <new-directory>` only when the current
   user request authorizes that exact board, artifact, port, and Flash write.
   Do not automatically retry a failed erase or write.
6. After BK Loader releases the COM port, run `debug-plan` to generate a
   board-safe command for `windows-hardware-debug`. Inspect it, then execute the
   generic tool only if capture/reset/J-Link control is in scope.
7. Report Flash transport, boot, functional behavior, and physical observation
   as separate gates.

## Current board profiles

- `aidk_ai_toy`: one 8 MiB BIN, CH340 UART0, loader-owned `reset reboot`, and no
  RTS/DTR reset. K1 is the manual fallback.
- `t5_board`: single or manifest-bounded multi-segment BK Loader input. UART0 is
  download plus console, and its USB-UART path supports inline RTS reset.
- `t5ai_core`: single or manifest-bounded multi-segment input. Download/reset
  and UART0 console are distinct COM ports; RTS is issued on the download/reset
  port. J-Link remains a separate guarded diagnostic path.

These names are aliases, not hard-coded COM assignments. Read
[references/board-profiles.json](references/board-profiles.json) for exact
defaults and evidence pointers. Add a new board only after its wiring, loader
form, reset mechanism, and console baud are evidenced; do not clone another
board's profile speculatively.

## Safety and acceptance

- Profile overrides fail closed unless `--allow-profile-override` is supplied
  after reviewing the electrical and loader consequences.
- AIDK must never use COM RTS/DTR. T5 RTS capability must never be generalized
  back to AIDK.
- Do not feed `.zip` or `.bkpack` directly to BK Loader. Do not chip erase,
  write OTP/eFuse, provision keys, or change lifecycle/debug-lock state.
- `FLASH_PASS` requires all required BK Loader success markers and no failure
  marker in the new log. The loader process exit code is advisory.
- `BOOT_PASS` requires fresh target-side boot evidence. `FUNCTION_PASS` requires
  the requested hardware path to run. `PHYSICAL_PASS` requires human observation
  for screens, sound, light, motion, or other non-log-visible effects.

## Resources

- `scripts/bk7258_hil_download.py --help`: deterministic interface.
- `scripts/test_bk7258_hil_download.py`: host-only regression tests; never opens
  a COM port or debugger.
- `references/SOP.zh-CN.md`: operator commands, evidence layout, and failure
  handling.
- Sibling `windows-hardware-debug/SKILL.md`: generic UART/reset/J-Link rules.
