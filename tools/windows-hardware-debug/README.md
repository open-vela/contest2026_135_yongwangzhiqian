# Windows / WSL2 Hardware Debug SOP

A board-independent toolkit for collecting exact UART logs, running guarded
SEGGER J-Link diagnostics, publishing bounded BLE test advertisements, and
running bounded BLE Central/GATT probes from Windows PowerShell or WSL2. It is
designed for both humans and coding agents such as Claude Code and Codex.

The toolkit deliberately does **not** implement flashing, erase, memory writes,
fuse/option-byte changes, or security-state changes. A successful host command
also does not prove that the target reset or changed state; target-side evidence
must be checked separately.

For BK7258 Flash transport, use the sibling
[`bk7258-hil-download`](../bk7258-hil-download/SKILL.md) skill. It owns BK Loader
preflight/evidence and board profiles, then hands post-download capture or reset
back to this toolkit. This keeps destructive chip-specific policy out of the
board-independent debugger.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11 with Windows PowerShell 5.1 or PowerShell 7
- A Windows-visible USB serial adapter, only for UART actions
- WSL2 with Windows executable interop, only when running from Linux
- SEGGER J-Link Software, only for J-Link actions
- A Windows BLE adapter with peripheral-role support, only for RF advertising
- Visual Studio Build Tools with C++ and a Windows SDK, only when rebuilding
  the BLE advertiser

No third-party PowerShell module is required. SEGGER software and drivers are
not distributed by this project and remain subject to SEGGER's terms.

## Quick start on Windows

Open PowerShell in this directory:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass
.\scripts\serial_capture.ps1 -ListPorts
```

Capture exact bytes without controlling the target:

```powershell
.\scripts\debug_session.ps1 `
  -ConsolePort COM11 -Baud 115200 -DurationSec 20 `
  -Action ManualReset -ExpectedRegex 'boot complete'
```

The script opens the console first, then asks you to reset the target. Replace
the example port, baud rate, and regex with board facts.

Pulse DTR/RTS on the same console adapter:

```powershell
.\scripts\debug_session.ps1 `
  -ConsolePort COM11 -Baud 115200 -DurationSec 20 `
  -Action SerialPulse -PulseMode DTR -PulseMs 100 `
  -AllowTargetControl -ExpectedRegex 'boot complete'
```

Use a separate control adapter by adding `-ResetPort COM7`.

Review a J-Link memory-read command without connecting to hardware:

```powershell
.\scripts\jlink_debug.ps1 `
  -Action ReadMemory -Device CORTEX-M33 `
  -Address 0x20000000 -Count 16 -Width 32 -DryRun
```

Remove `-DryRun` only after confirming the SEGGER device name and address.

## Quick start from WSL2

Windows owns the COM port; the WSL wrapper calls Windows PowerShell and converts
paths safely:

```bash
./scripts/debug_session_wsl.sh --list-ports

./scripts/debug_session_wsl.sh \
  --console-port COM11 \
  --baud 115200 \
  --duration 20 \
  --action manual-reset \
  --expected-regex 'boot complete' \
  --output-dir ./hardware-debug-logs/boot-001
```

For a J-Link reset-synchronized capture:

```bash
./scripts/debug_session_wsl.sh \
  --console-port COM11 \
  --baud 115200 \
  --action jlink-reset \
  --jlink-device CORTEX-M33 \
  --resume-after-reset \
  --allow-target-control \
  --expected-regex 'boot complete'
```

J-Link runs in command-file/no-GUI mode with exit-on-error enabled and an outer
timeout, following SEGGER's documented batch interface. See the
[J-Link Commander reference](https://kb.segger.com/J-Link_Commander).

## Output contract

Each `debug_session` directory contains:

| File | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `serial.raw` | Exact bytes received from the serial port |
| `serial.txt` | UTF-8 best-effort view for searching and regex checks |
| `serial.json` | Serial tool status, byte count, SHA-256, and timestamps |
| `serial-tool.log` | PowerShell capture process output |
| `action.log` | Manual, DTR/RTS, or J-Link action log |
| `action.json` | Structured action result when applicable |
| `session.json` | Combined verdict and evidence paths |

`session.json` uses `passed` only when every `ExpectedRegex` matched and no
`FailRegex` matched. Without expected evidence, a successful run is marked
`completed_unverified`.

The session refuses a nonempty output directory by default so prior evidence
cannot be mistaken for a new run. Use `-AllowOutputOverwrite` on Windows or
`--allow-output-overwrite` in WSL2 only when replacing the toolkit's known
output files is intentional.

## Use as an Agent Skill

The package root is also an Agent Skills-compatible directory. Keep the whole
directory together because `SKILL.md` refers to its scripts and SOP files.

For Codex, link or copy it into a repository's `.agents/skills/` or the user's
`$HOME/.agents/skills/`. Codex supports symlinked skill directories. See the
[official Codex skill documentation](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/build/skills).

For Claude Code, link or copy it into `.claude/skills/windows-hardware-debug/`
or `~/.claude/skills/windows-hardware-debug/`. See the
[official Claude Code skill documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills).

Example repository-local links from a repository that contains this directory
at `tools/windows-hardware-debug`:

```bash
mkdir -p .agents/skills .claude/skills
ln -s ../../tools/windows-hardware-debug .agents/skills/windows-hardware-debug
ln -s ../../tools/windows-hardware-debug .claude/skills/windows-hardware-debug
```

On Windows, copy the folder when symlink creation is unavailable.

## Scope and license

All hardware-specific values remain caller parameters. Keep board profiles,
memory maps, reset polarity, and acceptance regexes in the board repository,
not in this generic toolkit.

The toolkit is licensed under Apache-2.0. Before publishing it independently,
confirm that the chosen copyright holder and the parent repository's licensing
policy agree with that license.
